# The ACTUAL Issue After 4 Months

## Root Cause
**The RTP receive path is completely missing.**

While the send path is fully implemented (microphone → encoding → RTP transmission), there is **no implementation** for the receive path (RTP reception → decoding → speaker playback).

## Evidence

### ✅ Send Path (Working)
1. **sip-client**: `setup_audio_pipeline()` captures microphone audio
2. **sip-client**: Capture task calls `client.send_audio_frame()`  
3. **client-core**: Maps call_id → session_id, delegates to session-core
4. **session-core**: `MediaControl::send_audio_frame()` → `media_manager.send_audio_frame_for_transmission()`
5. **media-core**: `controller.encode_and_send_audio_frame()` encodes with G.711 and sends via RTP
6. **rtp-core**: `session.send_packet()` transmits UDP packets

### ❌ Receive Path (Missing)
1. **rtp-core**: Receives UDP packets ✅
2. **media-core**: `RtpBridge.process_incoming_packet()` only updates statistics ❌
3. **No decoding** of G.711 payload to PCM ❌  
4. **No routing** to audio callbacks ❌
5. **No playback** pipeline connection ❌

## The Missing Code

### Current `process_incoming_packet()`:
```rust
pub async fn process_incoming_packet(&self, session_id: &MediaSessionId, packet: MediaPacket) -> Result<()> {
    // Updates statistics only
    session_info.packets_received += 1;
    
    // Validates payload type
    if should_validate {
        self.validate_packet_payload(session_id, &packet).await?;
    }
    
    // Sends integration event
    let event = IntegrationEvent::new(/*...*/);
    
    // ❌ DOES NOT DECODE OR ROUTE AUDIO
    Ok(())
}
```

### What's Needed:
1. **Decode G.711 payload** to PCM samples
2. **Create AudioFrame** with decoded samples  
3. **Route to session-core** audio frame callbacks
4. **Connect to sip-client** playback pipeline
5. **Play through speakers**

## Why Previous Fixes Don't Work

All previous fixes addressed **signaling and configuration**:
- ✅ SDP negotiation works
- ✅ RTP endpoints are configured  
- ✅ Media flow is established
- ✅ UDP packets are transmitted and received

But **none addressed the missing receive path implementation**.

## The Real Fix

Implement the complete RTP → PCM → Playback pipeline:

1. **Media-Core**: Extend `RtpBridge.process_incoming_packet()` to decode audio
2. **Session-Core**: Route decoded frames to registered callbacks
3. **Client-Core**: Forward frames to sip-client  
4. **Sip-Client**: Send frames to playback pipeline → speakers

This is a significant implementation effort, not a configuration fix.
