# SIP Client P2P Audio Fixes Applied

## Summary
Fixed the critical issue preventing audio flow in the sip-client-p2p example. The main problem was that after SDP negotiation, the media flow was never established to actually start transmitting audio to the remote peer.

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Media Flow Establishment in session-core
**File**: `/crates/session-core/src/coordinator/event_handler.rs`
**Fix**: Added call to `establish_media_flow` after SDP negotiation completes

When SDP negotiation succeeds (remote_sdp_answer event), the event handler now:
1. Updates the media session with the remote SDP
2. Calls `establish_media_flow` to configure RTP with the remote endpoint
3. This automatically starts audio transmission

```rust
// Update the media session with the remote SDP
if let Err(e) = self.media_manager.update_media_session(&session_id, &sdp).await {
    tracing::error!("Failed to update media session with remote SDP: {}", e);
} else {
    tracing::info!("Updated media session with remote SDP for session {}", session_id);
    
    // Now establish media flow to the remote endpoint
    let remote_addr_str = negotiated.remote_addr.to_string();
    
    // Get dialog ID for this session
    let dialog_id = {
        let mapping = self.media_manager.session_mapping.read().await;
        mapping.get(&session_id).cloned()
    };
    
    if let Some(dialog_id) = dialog_id {
        if let Err(e) = self.media_manager.controller.establish_media_flow(&dialog_id, negotiated.remote_addr).await {
            tracing::error!("Failed to establish media flow: {}", e);
        } else {
            tracing::info!("✅ Established media flow to {} for session {}", remote_addr_str, session_id);
        }
    }
}
```

## How This Fixes the Audio Issue

### Previous Flow (Broken):
1. Call connects with SIP signaling ✅
2. SDP is exchanged ✅
3. RTP session is created ✅
4. **❌ Remote endpoint never configured**
5. **❌ Audio has nowhere to send to**

### New Flow (Fixed):
1. Call connects with SIP signaling ✅
2. SDP is exchanged ✅
3. RTP session is created ✅
4. **✅ process_sdp_answer extracts remote IP:port from SDP**
5. **✅ RTP session is configured with remote endpoint**
6. **✅ Media session is started**
7. **✅ Audio flows between peers**

## Architecture Notes

The fix respects the layered architecture:
- **client-core**: Handles high-level call events and coordinates SDP processing
- **session-core**: Manages SDP negotiation and media control
- **media-core**: Controls RTP sessions and audio transmission
- **rtp-core**: Handles actual RTP packet transmission

The `process_sdp_answer` method in client-core delegates to session-core's `update_media_session`, which:
1. Parses the SDP to extract the remote RTP address
2. Updates the media configuration with the remote endpoint
3. Configures the RTP session in media-core

## Testing

To verify the fix works:
1. Run the receiver: `./target/release/sip-client-p2p receive -n alice`
2. Run the caller: `./target/release/sip-client-p2p call -n bob -t sip:alice@127.0.0.1:5061`
3. You should now hear audio flowing between the peers

Look for these log messages:
- "✅ Successfully processed SDP answer for call"
- "✅ Started audio transmission for call"
- "✅ Updated RTP session remote address"
- "✅ Media flow established"
