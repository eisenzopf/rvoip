## 📋 Transfer Scenarios Supported

### 1. **Blind Transfer**
```
Alice ──INVITE──> Bob
Bob ──REFER──> Alice (Refer-To: Carol)
Alice ──202 Accepted──> Bob
Alice ──INVITE──> Carol
Alice ──BYE──> Bob
```

### 2. **Attended Transfer**
```
Alice ──INVITE──> Bob
Bob ──INVITE──> Carol (consultation)
Bob ──REFER──> Alice (Refer-To: Carol?Replaces=...)
Alice ──202 Accepted──> Bob
Alice ──INVITE──> Carol (with Replaces)
Bob ──BYE──> Carol
```

### 3. **Transfer Progress Tracking**
```
REFER Request → 202 Accepted → NOTIFY (100 Trying) → NOTIFY (180 Ringing) → NOTIFY (200 OK)
```

## 🔧 API Examples

### Basic Transfer Initiation
```rust
// Initiate a blind transfer
let transfer_id = session_manager.initiate_transfer(
    &session_id,
    "sip:target@example.com".to_string(),
    TransferType::Blind,
    Some("sip:referrer@example.com".to_string())
).await?;
```

### Handle Incoming REFER
```rust
// Process incoming REFER request
let transfer_id = session_manager.handle_refer_request(
    &refer_request,
    &dialog_id
).await?;
```

### Transfer Progress Updates
```rust
// Send transfer progress notification
session_manager.send_transfer_notify(
    &session_id,
    &transfer_id,
    "180 Ringing".to_string()
).await?;
```
