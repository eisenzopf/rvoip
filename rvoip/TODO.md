# rvoip Architecture TODO

This document outlines architectural recommendations and improvements for the rvoip project, focusing on proper layering and component responsibilities according to SIP RFCs and best practices.

## Recently Completed Major Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)

### ✅ **Timeout Error Reduction - COMPLETED** 
**Status**: **100% COMPLETE** - All timeout errors eliminated across the codebase

**Root Cause**: Broadcast channel anti-pattern where `receive_frame()` method was creating new subscribers on each call, causing frame loss and timeout errors.

**Solution**: Implemented persistent frame receiver pattern using `get_frame_receiver()` method for long-lived subscribers.

**Files Fixed**:
- ✅ `examples/api_srtp.rs` - Fixed timeout errors in SRTP example
- ✅ `examples/media_api_usage.rs` - Fixed timeout errors in media API usage
- ✅ `examples/minimal_connection_test.rs` - Preventive fix for consistency
- ✅ `examples/api_ssrc_demultiplexing_basic.rs` - Previously fixed
- ✅ `examples/api_ssrc_demultiplexing_advanced.rs` - Previously fixed

**Testing Results**: All examples now complete successfully with zero timeout errors.

### ✅ **SSRC Demultiplexing Issues - COMPLETED**
**Status**: **100% COMPLETE** - Perfect SSRC separation achieved

**Issues Fixed**:
1. ✅ Server configuration bug (hardcoded `ssrc_demultiplexing_enabled = false`)
2. ✅ Missing SSRC field in `RtpEvent::MediaReceived` events
3. ✅ Broadcast channel timeout issues (covered above)

**Results**: 
- Perfect SSRC separation: "SSRC=1234a001: 1 frames", "SSRC=5678b001: 1 frames"
- Zero timeout errors
- Complete frame processing

### ✅ **RTCP Multiplexing Compilation Fix - COMPLETED**
**Status**: **100% COMPLETE** - rtcp_mux example now working perfectly

**Root Cause**: Missing `ssrc` field in `RtpEvent::MediaReceived` pattern matches after SSRC demultiplexing improvements.

**Solution**: Updated all pattern matches to include the `ssrc` field and enhanced logging.

**Files Fixed**:
- ✅ `examples/rtcp_mux.rs` - Fixed compilation errors and enhanced SSRC logging

**Testing Results**: 
- ✅ RFC 5761 RTCP Multiplexing working perfectly
- ✅ Bidirectional RTP/RTCP communication successful
- ✅ Proper SSRC tracking and display (`SSRC=87654321`)
- ✅ RTCP packet parsing (SenderReport & Goodbye) functional

### ✅ **Payload Parsing Refinement - COMPLETED**
**Status**: **100% COMPLETE** - RFC 3551-compliant payload type registry implemented

**Root Cause**: Hardcoded, duplicated, and incorrect payload type logic scattered across multiple files violating RFC 3551 standards.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive payload type registry with RFC 3551 compliance and dynamic payload support.

**Improvements Made**:
- ✅ Created centralized `PayloadTypeRegistry` with RFC 3551 compliance
- ✅ Added support for all standard audio payload types (PCMU, PCMA, G722, G729, etc.)
- ✅ Added support for all standard video payload types (H261, H263, JPEG, etc.)  
- ✅ Implemented dynamic payload type support (96-127) for H264, VP8, VP9, Opus
- ✅ Replaced hardcoded logic in `default.rs` (3 instances) and `connection.rs` (2 instances)
- ✅ Added proper fallback behavior for unregistered payload types
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite and demo example

**Files Enhanced**:
- ✅ `src/payload/registry.rs` - New comprehensive payload type registry
- ✅ `src/api/server/transport/default.rs` - Replaced hardcoded logic with registry calls
- ✅ `src/api/server/transport/core/connection.rs` - Replaced hardcoded logic with registry calls
- ✅ `examples/payload_type_demo.rs` - New demo showcasing enhanced capabilities

**Testing Results**: 
- ✅ All examples work perfectly with enhanced payload type handling
- ✅ RFC 3551 compliance verified for all standard payload types
- ✅ Dynamic payload types (H264, VP8, VP9, Opus) properly supported
- ✅ Proper media frame type detection (Audio/Video/Data)
- ✅ Zero compilation errors or runtime issues

## Current Next Priorities (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

### ✅ **Duplicate Example Consolidation - COMPLETED**
**Status**: **100% COMPLETE** - Redundant example removed

**Issue**: `api_ssrc_demux.rs` and `api_ssrc_demultiplexing.rs` were 99% identical (only 2-line diff in security config style)

**Action Taken**:
- ✅ Removed `api_ssrc_demux.rs` (duplicate)
- ✅ Kept `api_ssrc_demultiplexing.rs` (more descriptive name)
- ✅ Verified both examples worked identically before removal

**Result**: Cleaner example codebase with no redundant functionality

### ✅ **Example Documentation & Cleanup - COMPLETED**
**Status**: **100% COMPLETE** - Comprehensive README.md created with full organization

**Root Cause**: Examples directory lacked comprehensive documentation and logical organization for 50+ examples.

## **🎯 Cross-Crate Integration Strategy**

### **Communication Patterns**
1. **Event-Driven**: Use `infra-common` event bus for loose coupling
2. **Trait-Based**: Lower crates define traits, higher crates implement
3. **Message Passing**: Async channels for real-time data flow
4. **Shared State**: Minimal, well-defined shared data structures

### **Development Workflow**
1. **Phase 2**: Establish patterns in single crate (`rtp-core`)
2. **Phase 3**: Extend patterns across 3 crates with event coordination
3. **Phase 4**: Scale patterns to complex multi-crate features
4. **Phase 5**: Advanced features with full architectural maturity

### **Quality Assurance**
- **Unit Tests**: Per-crate functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-crate communication
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full system scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: Scalability and latency
- **Compliance Tests**: Protocol conformance

These recommendations aim to strengthen the current architectural approach while ensuring adherence to SIP standards, proper separation of concerns, and scalability requirements across the entire RVOIP ecosystem.
