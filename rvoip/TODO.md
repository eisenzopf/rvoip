# rvoip Architecture TODO

This document outlines architectural recommendations and improvements for the rvoip project, focusing on proper layering and component responsibilities according to SIP RFCs and best practices.

## Recently Completed Major Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)

### ✅ **Timeout Error Reduction - COMPLETED** 
**Status**: **100% COMPLETE** - All timeout errors eliminated across the codebase

**Root Cause**: Broadcast channel anti-pattern where `receive_frame()` method was creating new subscribers on each call, causing frame loss and timeout errors.

**Solution**: Implemented persistent frame receiver pattern using `get_frame_receiver()` method for long-lived subscribers.

**Files Fixed**:
- ✅ `examples/api_srtp.rs` - Fixed timeout errors in SRTP example
- ✅ `examples/media_api_usage.rs` - Fixed timeout errors in media API usage
- ✅ `examples/minimal_connection_test.rs` - Preventive fix for consistency
- ✅ `examples/api_ssrc_demultiplexing_basic.rs` - Previously fixed
- ✅ `examples/api_ssrc_demultiplexing_advanced.rs` - Previously fixed

**Testing Results**: All examples now complete successfully with zero timeout errors.

### ✅ **SSRC Demultiplexing Issues - COMPLETED**
**Status**: **100% COMPLETE** - Perfect SSRC separation achieved

**Issues Fixed**:
1. ✅ Server configuration bug (hardcoded `ssrc_demultiplexing_enabled = false`)
2. ✅ Missing SSRC field in `RtpEvent::MediaReceived` events
3. ✅ Broadcast channel timeout issues (covered above)

**Results**: 
- Perfect SSRC separation: "SSRC=1234a001: 1 frames", "SSRC=5678b001: 1 frames"
- Zero timeout errors
- Complete frame processing

### ✅ **RTCP Multiplexing Compilation Fix - COMPLETED**
**Status**: **100% COMPLETE** - rtcp_mux example now working perfectly

**Root Cause**: Missing `ssrc` field in `RtpEvent::MediaReceived` pattern matches after SSRC demultiplexing improvements.

**Solution**: Updated all pattern matches to include the `ssrc` field and enhanced logging.

**Files Fixed**:
- ✅ `examples/rtcp_mux.rs` - Fixed compilation errors and enhanced SSRC logging

**Testing Results**: 
- ✅ RFC 5761 RTCP Multiplexing working perfectly
- ✅ Bidirectional RTP/RTCP communication successful
- ✅ Proper SSRC tracking and display (`SSRC=87654321`)
- ✅ RTCP packet parsing (SenderReport & Goodbye) functional

## Current Next Priorities (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

### ✅ **Duplicate Example Consolidation - COMPLETED**
**Status**: **100% COMPLETE** - Redundant example removed

**Issue**: `api_ssrc_demux.rs` and `api_ssrc_demultiplexing.rs` were 99% identical (only 2-line diff in security config style)

**Action Taken**:
- ✅ Removed `api_ssrc_demux.rs` (duplicate)
- ✅ Kept `api_ssrc_demultiplexing.rs` (more descriptive name)
- ✅ Verified both examples worked identically before removal

**Result**: Cleaner example codebase with no redundant functionality

### **🎯 NEXT: Payload Parsing Refinement - READY**
**Status**: **CURRENT PRIORITY** - Core functionality stable, ready for enhancement

**Focus Areas**:
- [ ] Optimize payload type handling across examples
- [ ] Enhance codec-specific payload processing
- [ ] Improve payload validation and error handling
- [ ] Add support for additional payload formats

### **3. Example Documentation & Cleanup - READY**
**Status**: **MAINTENANCE** - Clean up and document example codebase

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add README.md for examples directory
- [ ] Standardize example structure and patterns
- [ ] Add clear comments explaining each example's purpose
- [ ] Ensure consistent error handling across examples

## Layering Architecture

The current layering strategy is sound and follows RFC recommendations, but can be enhanced:

```
+--------------------------+       +--------------------------+
|     sip-client           |       |     call-engine          |
| (Client-side TU Logic)   |       | (Server-side TU Logic)   |
+--------------------------+       +--------------------------+
              |                                |
              v                                v
+--------------------------------------------------+
|                  session-core                    |
|            (Core TU Functionality)               |
+--------------------------------------------------+
        |               |                |
        v               v                v
+-------------+  +-------------+  +-------------+
| transaction |  |    media    |  |     ice     |
|    core     |  |    core     |  |    core     |
+-------------+  +-------------+  +-------------+
        |               |                |
        v               v                v
+-------------+  +-------------+  +-------------+
|  sip-core   |  |  rtp-core   |  |     ...     |
+-------------+  +-------------+  +-------------+
        |               |                |
        v               v                v
+--------------------------------------------------+
|                  sip-transport                   |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```
