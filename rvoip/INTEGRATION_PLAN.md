# Session Manager Integration Plan

**Goal**: Establish `session-core` as the central coordination layer that provides a unified API for SIP clients and servers, coordinating between SIP signaling and RTP media streams.

## Overview

The Session Manager will serve as the primary interface that:
- Manages SIP session lifecycle (creation, state transitions, termination)
- Coordinates SIP dialogs with RTP media streams
- Provides clean separation of concerns while maintaining integration
- Offers a unified event system for all session-related activities
- Exposes high-level APIs that hide protocol complexity

- **Dialog Management**: All dialog coordination maintained

### âœ… Production Readiness Benefits

#### âœ… Enhanced Maintainability
- **Faster Development**: Developers can focus on specific modules
- **Easier Bug Fixes**: Issues can be isolated to specific functionality areas
- **Improved Testing**: Individual modules can be tested in isolation
- **Code Review Efficiency**: Smaller, focused files are easier to review

#### âœ… Scalability Improvements
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple developers can work on different modules
- **Feature Addition**: New functionality can be added to appropriate modules
- **Performance Optimization**: Specific areas can be optimized independently
- **Documentation**: Module-specific documentation becomes more manageable

#### âœ… Architecture Quality
- **Clean Separation**: Clear boundaries between different concerns
- **Dependency Management**: Reduced coupling between different functionalities
- **Code Organization**: Follows Rust best practices for module structure
- **Professional Standards**: Production-ready code organization

## Updated Current Sprint: Next Implementation Priorities

### âœ… COMPLETED: Major Code Refactoring (Week 0)
- [x] **Modular Architecture Achievement**
  - [x] Session module split into 4 focused files (core, state, media, transfer)
  - [x] SessionManager module split into 4 focused files (core, lifecycle, media, transfer)
  - [x] Zero compilation errors achieved
  - [x] 100% functionality preservation

### ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus: Call Transfer Implementation (Week 1-2) - **NEXT PRIORITY**

**Status**: ðŸ”„ **Infrastructure Complete, Implementation Ready**

**Already Available:**
- [x] Transfer module structure in place (`session/transfer.rs`, `manager/transfer.rs`)
- [x] Transfer types and state management (`TransferContext`, `TransferState`)
- [x] Basic transfer coordination framework
- [x] Event system for transfer progress

**Next Implementation Tasks:**
```rust
// Priority 1: REFER Method Integration
impl SessionManager {
    // REFER request processing for call transfers
    pub async fn handle_refer_request(&self, session_id: &SessionId, refer: Request) -> Result<(), Error>;
    pub async fn process_refer_response(&self, session_id: &SessionId, response: Response) -> Result<(), Error>;
    
    // Transfer coordination between sessions
    pub async fn initiate_transfer(&self, session_id: &SessionId, target: Uri, transfer_type: TransferType) -> Result<TransferId, Error>;
    pub async fn complete_attended_transfer(&self, session_a_id: &SessionId, session_b_id: &SessionId) -> Result<(), Error>;
}

impl Session {
    // Transfer state management
    pub async fn start_transfer(&self, target: Uri, transfer_type: TransferType) -> Result<TransferId, Error>;
    pub async fn accept_transfer(&self, transfer_id: &TransferId) -> Result<(), Error>;
    pub async fn complete_transfer(&self, transfer_id: &TransferId) -> Result<(), Error>;
    pub async fn fail_transfer(&self, transfer_id: &TransferId, reason: String) -> Result<(), Error>;
}
```

**Implementation Plan:**
