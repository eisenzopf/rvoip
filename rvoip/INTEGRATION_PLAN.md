# Session Manager Integration Plan

**Goal**: Establish `session-core` as the central coordination layer that provides a unified API for SIP clients and servers, coordinating between SIP signaling and RTP media streams.

## Overview

The Session Manager will serve as the primary interface that:
- Manages SIP session lifecycle (creation, state transitions, termination)
- Coordinates SIP dialogs with RTP media streams
- Provides clean separation of concerns while maintaining integration
- Offers a unified event system for all session-related activities
- Exposes high-level APIs that hide protocol complexity
