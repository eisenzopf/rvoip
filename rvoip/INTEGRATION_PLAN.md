# Session Manager Integration Plan

**Goal**: Establish `session-core` as the central coordination layer that provides a unified API for SIP clients and servers, coordinating between SIP signaling and RTP media streams.

## Overview

The Session Manager will serve as the primary interface that:
- Manages SIP session lifecycle (creation, state transitions, termination)
- Coordinates SIP dialogs with RTP media streams
- Provides clean separation of concerns while maintaining integration
- Offers a unified event system for all session-related activities
- Exposes high-level APIs that hide protocol complexity

## Updated Success Criteria

### Basic SIP Functionality Integration
1. ðŸ”„ **Call-Engine Integration**: SessionManager provides session management for call routing
2. ðŸ”„ **SIP-Client Integration**: Enhanced helper functions support complete call flows  
3. ðŸ”„ **Authentication Integration**: Session-level authentication with call-engine
4. ðŸ”„ **Media Relay Support**: RTP forwarding coordination for proxy scenarios
5. ðŸ”„ **End-to-End Call Flows**: Registration â†’ authentication â†’ call setup â†’ media â†’ teardown

### Component Integration Success
1. **call-engine** can use SessionManager for call state management
2. **sip-client** can use enhanced helpers for simplified call handling
3. **media-core** integration provides automatic RTP stream management
4. **Basic SIP server** functionality works end-to-end
5. **Standard SIP clients** can interoperate successfully

These integration tasks ensure that session-core properly supports the basic SIP server and client requirements outlined in BASIC_SIP_TODO.md while maintaining its role as the central coordination layer.

## Migration Notes

### Existing Code Compatibility
- Current SessionManager API is preserved - this is purely additive
- Dialog management remains unchanged - MediaManager is a new layer
- Helper functions maintain backward compatibility
- Event system is extended, not replaced

### Future Integration Points
- **call-engine**: Will use enhanced SessionManager for high-level call management
- **sip-client**: Will leverage the unified API for simplified client implementation
- **api-server**: Will expose session management via REST/WebSocket APIs
- **media-recorder**: Will integrate with MediaManager for recording coordination

## Current Status Summary

**âœ… COMPLETE (Phase 1)**: Strong foundation with session management, dialog integration, and SDP negotiation

**ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS (Phase 2)**: Media integration is the current focus - MediaManager design and implementation

**ðŸ”œ PLANNED (Phase 3-4)**: Advanced features and production hardening

The session-core architecture is well-positioned to serve as the central coordination layer. The immediate focus should be on completing the media integration to provide the unified SIP+media API that will serve both client and server use cases.
