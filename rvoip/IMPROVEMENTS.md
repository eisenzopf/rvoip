Architecture Assessment
The architecture follows a well-structured layered design that aligns with SIP RFC guidelines and industry best practices:
Strong modular design: Proper separation of concerns across specialized crates
Async-first approach: Built on Tokio for scalability and non-blocking I/O
Pure Rust implementation: Modern approach with improved safety features
Crate-by-Crate Assessment
sip-core
Strengths: Complete message parsing, URI handling, header management
Areas for improvement:
Consider optimizing parser performance with better nom patterns
Add more validation for SIP compliance edge cases
sip-transport
Strengths: Clean separation of transport concerns
Areas for improvement:
Add TCP, TLS, and WebSocket transport (currently appears UDP-focused)
Implement connection pooling and backpressure handling
Consider adding transport layer security features
transaction-core
Strengths: Well-structured client/server transaction state machines
Areas for improvement:
Enhance transaction matching for high-throughput scenarios
Implement more optimized timer management
Add benchmarks to ensure performance at scale
session-core
Strengths: Comprehensive SDP handling, dialog management
Areas for improvement:
Consider adopting a more explicit state machine pattern
Optimize dialog matching for high call volumes
Add support for more advanced call flows
rtp-core
Strengths: Clean packet handling, RTCP support
Areas for improvement:
Add SRTP support for secure media
Implement more aggressive packet loss handling
Add jitter buffer optimization
media-core
Strengths: Framework for codec handling
Areas for improvement:
Currently only G.711 is implemented; add Opus, G.722
Add transcoding capabilities
Implement media path optimization
call-engine
Strengths: Good foundation for routing and policy
Areas for improvement:
Add more sophisticated routing algorithms
Implement call rate limiting and throttling
Add call metrics collection
sip-client
Strengths: Comprehensive library for SIP user agents
Areas for improvement:
Add more authentication mechanisms
Implement better retry logic
Add connectivity monitoring
Recommendations for Kamailio-level Scalability
Add connection pooling: Implement efficient SIP transport with connection reuse
Implement stateless proxy capabilities: For maximum throughput in routing scenarios
Add distributed transaction storage: Use a shared cache like Redis for state
Implement traffic throttling: Add rate limiting at multiple layers
Add metrics collection: For performance monitoring and tuning
Recommendations for FreeSWITCH-level Media Handling
Expand codec support: Add Opus, G.722, and other modern codecs
Implement media path optimization: Direct media when possible
Add transcoding framework: For codec negotiation mismatches
Implement SRTP and DTLS: For secure media transport
Add ICE/STUN/TURN: For NAT traversal
Optimize jitter buffer: For better voice quality
