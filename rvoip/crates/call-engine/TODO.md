# Call Engine - Call Center Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the `call-engine` crate, which serves as the **call center orchestration layer** in the RVOIP architecture, integrating with session-core for SIP handling and providing call center business logic.

## 🎯 **CURRENT STATUS: PERFECT SEPARATION OF CONCERNS ACHIEVED** ✅

### ✅ **MAJOR MILESTONE: API-Only Integration Complete** 

We have achieved **perfect separation of concerns** with **exclusive session-core API usage**:

#### ✅ **API Interface Completeness** - **COMPLETED**
- [✅] **Enhanced Session-Core API**: Added missing types (`SessionId`, `Session`, notification types) to API re-exports
- [✅] **Complete API Coverage**: All call-engine needs available through `rvoip_session_core::api::`
- [✅] **Zero Core Imports**: No direct imports from session-core internal modules
- [✅] **Clean Architecture**: Perfect abstraction layer separation

#### ✅ **Call-Engine API Usage** - **COMPLETED**  
- [✅] **Exclusive API Imports**: All imports from `rvoip_session_core::api::*` only
- [✅] **No Direct Core Access**: Removed all imports from `session::bridge::*` and core modules
- [✅] **Consistent Usage**: Both orchestrator and prelude use API interface exclusively
- [✅] **Clean Compilation**: Zero compilation errors with API-only usage

```rust
// ✅ PERFECT: Clean API-only usage
use rvoip_session_core::api::{
    // Basic session types from API
    SessionId, Session,
    // Server management  
    ServerSessionManager, ServerConfig, create_full_server_manager,
    IncomingCallEvent, CallerInfo, CallDecision, IncomingCallNotification,
    // Bridge management
    BridgeId, BridgeConfig, BridgeInfo, BridgeEvent, BridgeEventType,
};
```

### ✅ **Phase 1: Session-Core Integration Foundation - COMPLETED**

#### ✅ 1.1 Real Session-Core Integration - **COMPLETED**
- [✅] **REAL API INTEGRATION**: Using `create_full_server_manager()` correctly
- [✅] **REAL SESSION CREATION**: Agents registered with `create_outgoing_session()`
- [✅] **INCOMING CALL HANDLING**: Complete `IncomingCallNotification` trait implementation
- [✅] **BRIDGE MANAGEMENT**: Real bridge APIs (`bridge_sessions`, `create_bridge`, `destroy_bridge`)
- [✅] **EVENT MONITORING**: Bridge event subscriptions and real-time notifications
- [✅] **TRANSACTION INTEGRATION**: Proper TransactionManager setup with transport
- [✅] **SESSION TRACKING**: Real SessionId assignment and availability management
- [✅] **PERFECT SEPARATION**: Exclusive API usage with no architectural compromises

#### ✅ 1.2 Bridge Management Integration - **COMPLETED**
- [✅] **Real Bridge APIs**: Using session-core `bridge_sessions()` API successfully
- [✅] **Bridge Lifecycle**: Create, manage, and destroy bridges working
- [✅] **Event Monitoring**: Subscribe to bridge events for real-time updates
- [✅] **Agent-Customer Bridging**: Ready for Phase 2 call routing implementation

#### ✅ 1.3 Complete Engine Integration - **COMPLETED**
- [✅] **SessionManager Integration**: CallCenterEngine has real ServerSessionManager
- [✅] **Real Session Processing**: Using session-core for actual session management
- [✅] **Transaction Integration**: Proper TransactionManager setup with real transport
- [✅] **Clean Compilation**: Zero compilation errors
- [✅] **Working Examples**: Demonstrable real session-core integration
- [✅] **Proper Architecture**: Perfect separation of concerns achieved

## 🚀 **WHAT WE ACHIEVED IN LATEST MILESTONE:**

### 🎯 **Perfect API Architecture**
1. **Session-Core API Enhanced**: Added missing types to make API complete for call-engine needs
2. **Clean Import Structure**: All call-engine imports now use `rvoip_session_core::api::*` exclusively  
3. **Zero Architectural Debt**: No mixing of API and core imports - perfect separation
4. **Future-Proof Design**: Changes to session-core internals won't affect call-engine

### 🎯 **Working Integration Proof**
```
✅ ServerSessionManager created successfully
✅ Agent agent-001 registered with session-core (session: 4c0ccfbe-c903-4d4d-acbf-6dfd1956f49c)
✅ Agent agent-002 registered with session-core (session: 1bf08e0b-2921-42ff-ab8d-4455580dbd96)  
✅ Agent agent-003 registered with session-core (session: e01406c2-465a-4e2c-a474-abd2b478b7b4)
📊 Available Agents: 3
🌉 Bridge management capabilities active
📞 Listening for incoming calls on 127.0.0.1:5060
```

### 🎯 **Architecture Quality**
