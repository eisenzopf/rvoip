# Call Engine TODO

## 🎉 Current Status: Basic Call Delivery Working!

**Great News**: Phase 0 is complete! The call engine can now:
- Accept agent registrations via SIP REGISTER
- Receive incoming customer calls
- Route calls to available agents
- Create outgoing calls to agents
- Bridge customer and agent audio
- Handle call teardown properly

**Next Priority**: Phase 0.6 - Fix queue management issues discovered during testing

## Overview
The Call Engine is responsible for managing call center operations, including agent management, call queuing, routing, and session management. It builds on top of session-core to provide call center-specific functionality.

## Architecture
- **Session Management**: Uses SessionCoordinator from session-core
- **Agent Management**: Tracks agent states and availability
- **Queue Management**: Manages call queues with various strategies
- **Routing Engine**: Routes calls based on skills, availability, and business rules
- **Bridge Management**: Uses session-core's bridge API for agent-customer connections

## ✅ COMPLETED: Session-Core Integration

The integration with session-core has been successfully completed:

### What Was Done:
1. **Updated Imports**: Now correctly imports SessionCoordinator and related types
2. **Bridge Management**: Uses session-core's bridge API for connecting calls
3. **Event System**: Monitors bridge events for real-time updates
4. **Clean Architecture**: Call-engine focuses on call center logic, not SIP details

### Key Components:
- `CallCenterEngine`: Main orchestrator using SessionCoordinator
- `AgentManager`: Manages agent states and sessions
- `QueueManager`: Handles call queuing logic
- `RoutingEngine`: Implements call distribution algorithms

## Current Status

### Phase 0: Basic Call Delivery (Prerequisite) ✅ COMPLETE

**Critical**: Without this foundation, agents cannot receive calls and the system is non-functional.

#### 0.1 Fix Call-Engine Integration with Session-Core ✅
- [x] Remove references to non-existent types (IncomingCallNotificationTrait, ServerSessionManager, etc.)
- [x] Replace with correct session-core types (SessionCoordinator, CallHandler, etc.)
- [x] Update imports in `src/orchestrator/core.rs` to use actual session-core API

**Completed**: Removed all non-existent type references and now using proper session-core API types.

#### 0.2 Implement CallHandler for Call-Engine ✅
- [x] Create `CallCenterCallHandler` struct that implements session-core's CallHandler trait
- [x] Implement `on_incoming_call()` to route calls through call-engine's routing logic
- [x] Implement `on_call_ended()` to clean up call state
- [x] Implement `on_call_established()` to track active calls

**Completed**: Created CallCenterCallHandler with weak reference to avoid circular dependencies.

#### 0.3 Update CallCenterEngine Creation ✅
- [x] Use SessionManagerBuilder with the CallCenterCallHandler
- [x] Remove complex notification handler setup code
- [x] Store reference to SessionCoordinator for making outbound calls
- [x] Test that incoming calls reach the CallHandler

**Completed**: CallCenterEngine now properly creates SessionCoordinator with our CallHandler. Created example `phase0_basic_call_flow` to demonstrate.

#### 0.4 Agent Registration & Call Delivery ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Design how agents register their SIP endpoints (store in database)
- [x] Create SipRegistrar module for handling SIP REGISTER requests
- [x] Discovered dialog-core already handles REGISTER and forwards to session-core
- [x] Added handle_register_request() method to CallCenterEngine
- [x] Integration with existing stack:
  - [x] Added SessionEvent::RegistrationRequest variant
  - [x] Updated SessionDialogCoordinator to forward REGISTER events
  - [x] Added event monitoring in CallCenterEngine
  - [x] Connected SipRegistrar to process registrations
  - [x] Send proper SIP responses back through dialog-core API ✅
    
**✅ FIXED: Auto-Response Problem**

Successfully disabled auto-response and implemented proper REGISTER handling:

1. **Phase 1: Disable Auto-Response** ✅
   - [x] Configured DialogBuilder without `auto_register_response`
   - [x] dialog-core now forwards REGISTER without responding

2. **Phase 2: Expose Response API** ✅
   - [x] Added send_sip_response() to SessionCoordinator
   - [x] Made SessionDialogCoordinator.send_response() public
   - [x] Transaction ID flows correctly through event chain

3. **Phase 3: Proper Response Handling** ✅
   - [x] CallCenterEngine builds proper SIP responses:
     - Status codes (200 OK for success/refresh, 404 for errors)
     - Expires header with registration expiration
   - [x] Responses sent through session-core API
   - [ ] Add Contact headers with registration details

**What's Working Now:**
- REGISTER requests flow: SIP endpoint → dialog-core → session-core → CallCenterEngine
- SipRegistrar processes registrations (create, refresh, remove)
- Proper SIP responses sent back with correct status and headers
- No more auto-response race condition!

**Remaining Tasks (Not Critical for Basic Operation):**
- [x] Add Contact headers in responses ✅
- [ ] Handle authentication (401 challenges) - for production security
- [ ] Support multiple registrations per agent - for multi-device support
- [ ] Add timeout handling for abandoned registrations
- [x] Link REGISTER authentication with agent database:
  - [x] Parse AOR and match with agent records ✅
  - [ ] Validate agent credentials (digest auth)
  - [x] Update agent status when registration succeeds ✅
- [x] When routing decision selects an agent:
  - [x] Look up agent's current contact URI from registrations
  - [x] Create outbound INVITE to agent's registered contact
  - [x] Use session-core's bridge functionality to connect customer and agent
  - [x] Fixed parameter order bug in create_outgoing_call (FROM/TO were swapped)
- [ ] Handle registration scenarios:
  - [ ] Initial registration with authentication
  - [ ] Registration refresh (before expiry)
  - [ ] De-registration (expires=0)
  - [ ] Multiple registrations per agent (multiple devices)
  - [ ] Registration expiry and cleanup
- [x] Handle agent availability:
  - [x] Agent offline (no active registration)
  - [x] Agent busy (active but on calls)
  - [x] Agent available (registered and ready)

**In Progress**: Discovered that dialog-core/session-core already have REGISTER support. Need to:
1. Configure dialog-core to forward REGISTER (not auto-respond)
2. Hook into session-core's event handling to process registrations
3. Use our SipRegistrar to manage the registration state

#### 0.5 End-to-End Testing ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create test scenario: customer calls → CallHandler receives it → routes to agent
- [x] Test call bridging between customer and agent
- [x] Verify media path establishment
- [x] Test multiple concurrent calls
- [x] Validate call teardown and cleanup

**Completed**: Created comprehensive E2E test suite with:
- Call center server example
- Agent client application  
- SIPp test scenarios
- Automated test runner with PCAP capture
- Full documentation in examples/e2e_test/
- ✅ Successfully tested: Customer → Server → Agent call flow works!
- ✅ Fixed critical bug in agent call creation (parameter order)

**Estimated Time**: 1 week (much simpler than original estimate)
**Priority**: MUST COMPLETE before any other phases

**Key Insight**: No session-core changes needed - just use the existing CallHandler API correctly!

**Progress Summary**: 
- ✅ Core integration completed (0.1, 0.2, 0.3)
- ✅ Agent delivery integration completed (0.4)
  - SIP REGISTER events flow correctly without auto-response
  - SipRegistrar processes registrations
  - Proper SIP responses sent back through the stack
  - Contact headers added to responses

  - Agent calls now successfully created and bridged
  - Only missing for production: Authentication (401 challenges) and multiple registrations per agent
- ✅ End-to-end testing completed (0.5)
  - Comprehensive test suite with automated testing
  - Agent client application for testing
  - SIPp scenarios for customer calls
  - PCAP capture and analysis
- **Overall**: Phase 0 COMPLETE! Basic call delivery works end-to-end

**What's Working Now**:
- ✅ Agents can register via SIP REGISTER
- ✅ Incoming customer calls are properly received
- ✅ Calls are routed to available agents
- ✅ Outgoing calls to agents work correctly
- ✅ Customer-agent audio is bridged successfully
- ✅ End-to-end call flow: Customer → Server → Agent → Bridge

### Phase 0.6: Queue Management Fixes 🔧 NEW

**Critical Issues Found During E2E Testing**:
