# Call Engine - Call Center Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the `call-engine` crate, which serves as the **call center orchestration layer** in the RVOIP architecture, integrating with session-core for SIP handling and providing call center business logic.

## üéØ **CURRENT STATUS: PERFECT SEPARATION OF CONCERNS ACHIEVED** ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ **MAJOR MILESTONE: API-Only Integration Complete** 

We have achieved **perfect separation of concerns** with **exclusive session-core API usage**:

#### ‚úÖ **API Interface Completeness** - **COMPLETED**
- [‚úÖ] **Enhanced Session-Core API**: Added missing types (`SessionId`, `Session`, notification types) to API re-exports
- [‚úÖ] **Complete API Coverage**: All call-engine needs available through `rvoip_session_core::api::`
- [‚úÖ] **Zero Core Imports**: No direct imports from session-core internal modules
- [‚úÖ] **Clean Architecture**: Perfect abstraction layer separation

#### ‚úÖ **Call-Engine API Usage** - **COMPLETED**  
- [‚úÖ] **Exclusive API Imports**: All imports from `rvoip_session_core::api::*` only
- [‚úÖ] **No Direct Core Access**: Removed all imports from `session::bridge::*` and core modules
- [‚úÖ] **Consistent Usage**: Both orchestrator and prelude use API interface exclusively
- [‚úÖ] **Clean Compilation**: Zero compilation errors with API-only usage

```rust
// ‚úÖ PERFECT: Clean API-only usage
use rvoip_session_core::api::{
    // Basic session types from API
    SessionId, Session,
    // Server management  
    ServerSessionManager, ServerConfig, create_full_server_manager,
    IncomingCallEvent, CallerInfo, CallDecision, IncomingCallNotification,
    // Bridge management
    BridgeId, BridgeConfig, BridgeInfo, BridgeEvent, BridgeEventType,
};
```
