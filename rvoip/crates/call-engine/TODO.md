# Call Engine - Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the `call-engine` crate, which serves as the high-level orchestration layer in the RVOIP architecture, integrating session-core (signaling) and media-core (media processing).

## Architecture and Role

The call-engine provides:
- High-level call control API for applications
- Integration between signaling and media components
- Policy enforcement for call routing and features
- User-facing call state abstractions
- Resource coordination across component layers

## Standardized Event Bus Implementation
