# Call Engine TODO

## Overview
The Call Engine is responsible for managing call center operations, including agent management, call queuing, routing, and session management. It builds on top of session-core to provide call center-specific functionality.

## Architecture
- **Session Management**: Uses SessionCoordinator from session-core
- **Agent Management**: Tracks agent states and availability
- **Queue Management**: Manages call queues with various strategies
- **Routing Engine**: Routes calls based on skills, availability, and business rules
- **Bridge Management**: Uses session-core's bridge API for agent-customer connections

## âœ… COMPLETED: Session-Core Integration

The integration with session-core has been successfully completed:

### What Was Done:
1. **Updated Imports**: Now correctly imports SessionCoordinator and related types
2. **Bridge Management**: Uses session-core's bridge API for connecting calls
3. **Event System**: Monitors bridge events for real-time updates
4. **Clean Architecture**: Call-engine focuses on call center logic, not SIP details

### Key Components:
- `CallCenterEngine`: Main orchestrator using SessionCoordinator
- `AgentManager`: Manages agent states and sessions
- `QueueManager`: Handles call queuing logic
- `RoutingEngine`: Implements call distribution algorithms

## Current Status

### Phase 0: Basic Call Delivery (Prerequisite) ðŸš¨

**Critical**: Without this foundation, agents cannot receive calls and the system is non-functional.

#### 0.1 Fix Call-Engine Integration with Session-Core
- [ ] Remove references to non-existent types (IncomingCallNotificationTrait, ServerSessionManager, etc.)
- [ ] Replace with correct session-core types (SessionCoordinator, CallHandler, etc.)
- [ ] Update imports in `src/orchestrator/core.rs` to use actual session-core API

#### 0.2 Implement CallHandler for Call-Engine
- [ ] Create `CallCenterCallHandler` struct that implements session-core's CallHandler trait
- [ ] Implement `on_incoming_call()` to route calls through call-engine's routing logic
- [ ] Implement `on_call_ended()` to clean up call state
- [ ] Implement `on_call_established()` to track active calls

#### 0.3 Update CallCenterEngine Creation
- [ ] Use SessionManagerBuilder with the CallCenterCallHandler
- [ ] Remove complex notification handler setup code
- [ ] Store reference to SessionCoordinator for making outbound calls
- [ ] Test that incoming calls reach the CallHandler

#### 0.4 Agent Registration & Call Delivery
- [ ] Design how agents register their SIP endpoints (store in database)
- [ ] When routing decision selects an agent, create outbound call to agent's SIP URI
- [ ] Use session-core's bridge functionality to connect customer and agent
- [ ] Handle agent busy/no-answer scenarios

#### 0.5 End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Create test scenario: customer calls â†’ CallHandler receives it â†’ routes to agent
- [ ] Test call bridging between customer and agent
- [ ] Verify media path establishment
- [ ] Test multiple concurrent calls
- [ ] Validate call teardown and cleanup

**Estimated Time**: 1 week (much simpler than original estimate)
**Priority**: MUST COMPLETE before any other phases

**Key Insight**: No session-core changes needed - just use the existing CallHandler API correctly!
