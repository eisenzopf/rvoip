# Call Engine - Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the `call-engine` crate, which serves as the high-level orchestration layer in the RVOIP architecture, integrating session-core (signaling) and media-core (media processing).

3. Session B calls in → CallOrchestrator receives notification  
4. CallOrchestrator: "Bridge Session A ↔ Session B" (routing decision)
5. CallOrchestrator calls: session_manager.create_bridge()
6. CallOrchestrator calls: session_manager.add_session_to_bridge(session_a)
7. CallOrchestrator calls: session_manager.add_session_to_bridge(session_b)
8. Session-core handles all RTP forwarding mechanics
9. Audio flows: UAC A ↔ Bridge ↔ UAC B (orchestrated by call-engine!)
```

**Clean Separation Achieved**:
- ✅ **Call-Engine**: Makes all policy decisions and orchestrates features
- ✅ **Session-Core**: Provides technical infrastructure and mechanics
- ✅ **Clean APIs**: Call-engine uses session-core bridge APIs
- ✅ **Event-Driven**: Session-core notifies call-engine of state changes

**This creates the proper production SIP server orchestration layer!**
