# Call Engine TODO

## Overview
The Call Engine is responsible for managing call center operations, including agent management, call queuing, routing, and session management. It builds on top of session-core to provide call center-specific functionality.

## Architecture
- **Session Management**: Uses SessionCoordinator from session-core
- **Agent Management**: Tracks agent states and availability
- **Queue Management**: Manages call queues with various strategies
- **Routing Engine**: Routes calls based on skills, availability, and business rules
- **Bridge Management**: Uses session-core's bridge API for agent-customer connections

## âœ… COMPLETED: Session-Core Integration

The integration with session-core has been successfully completed:

### What Was Done:
1. **Updated Imports**: Now correctly imports SessionCoordinator and related types
2. **Bridge Management**: Uses session-core's bridge API for connecting calls
3. **Event System**: Monitors bridge events for real-time updates
4. **Clean Architecture**: Call-engine focuses on call center logic, not SIP details

### Key Components:
- `CallCenterEngine`: Main orchestrator using SessionCoordinator
- `AgentManager`: Manages agent states and sessions
- `QueueManager`: Handles call queuing logic
- `RoutingEngine`: Implements call distribution algorithms

## Current Status

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure âœ…
- [x] **Session Integration**: Successfully integrated with session-core
- [x] **Basic Architecture**: Core components in place
- [x] **Agent Management**: Basic agent registration and state tracking
- [x] **Queue Management**: FIFO queue implementation
- [x] **Bridge Support**: Can bridge customer and agent sessions

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features ðŸ”„
- [ ] **Advanced Routing**: Skill-based routing, priority queues
- [ ] **Database Integration**: Persistent state management
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and monitoring
- [ ] **API Server**: REST/WebSocket API for control
- [ ] **Conference Support**: Multi-party call support

### Phase 3: Production Features ðŸ”œ
- [ ] **High Availability**: Clustering and failover
- [ ] **Call Recording**: Integration with media recording
- [ ] **Analytics**: Call center analytics and reporting
- [ ] **IVR Integration**: Interactive Voice Response support
- [ ] **External Integrations**: CRM, ticketing systems

## Next Steps

1. **Enhanced Routing**
   - Implement skill-based routing
   - Add priority queue support
   - Create routing strategies (round-robin, least-busy, etc.)

2. **Database Layer**
   - Design schema for persistent state
   - Implement database repositories
   - Add transaction support

3. **API Development**
   - Define REST API endpoints
   - Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
   - Create client SDKs

4. **Testing**
   - Add comprehensive unit tests
   - Create integration test scenarios
   - Performance testing

## Dependencies
- `session-core`: âœ… Integrated - provides SIP session management
- `transaction-core`: âœ… Via session-core
- `sip-core`: âœ… For SIP types and utilities
- `tokio`: âœ… Async runtime
- `sqlx`: ðŸ”œ For database integration
- `axum`: ðŸ”œ For API server
