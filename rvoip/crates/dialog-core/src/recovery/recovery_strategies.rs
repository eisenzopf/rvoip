//! Dialog Recovery Strategies
//!
//! This module implements various strategies for recovering SIP dialogs
//! from network failures, transport issues, and other communication problems.
//!
//! ## Recovery Strategy Types
//!
//! - **Immediate Retry**: Quick retry for transient network issues
//! - **Exponential Backoff**: Progressive delay between retry attempts
//! - **Alternative Routes**: Try different network paths or servers
//! - **Protocol Fallback**: Fall back to more reliable transport protocols
//! - **Graceful Termination**: Clean termination when recovery is impossible
//!
//! ## Strategy Selection
//!
//! The choice of recovery strategy depends on:
//! - Type of failure detected
//! - Dialog state and importance
//! - Number of previous recovery attempts
//! - Available network resources
//!
//! ## Implementation Status
//!
//! Basic recovery logic is implemented in the recovery manager.
//! This module will contain specific strategy implementations when completed.
