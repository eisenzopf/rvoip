//! SIMD optimizations for audio processing

//! This module provides platform-specific SIMD optimizations
//! with fallback to scalar implementations.

/// SIMD-optimized audio processing
/// 
/// Note: For G.711 frames (160 samples), scalar processing with lookup tables
/// is actually faster than SIMD due to setup overhead. This processor provides
/// both for flexibility, but defaults to scalar for optimal performance.
