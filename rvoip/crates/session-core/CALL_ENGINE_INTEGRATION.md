# Call-Engine Integration with Session-Core

## ✅ INTEGRATION COMPLETE

The integration between call-engine and session-core has been successfully completed. Call-engine now uses SessionCoordinator as its primary interface for all SIP and media operations.

## Implementation Summary

### Architecture Decision

Instead of creating a separate `ServerSessionManager` layer, we **extended SessionCoordinator directly** with the functionality call-engine needs. This maintains the unified architecture that makes session-core elegant.

### Key Design Principles

1. **SessionCoordinator is the unified API** - One interface for both client and server use cases
2. **Bridges are 2-party conferences** - Reuses existing conference infrastructure
3. **Event-driven architecture** - Bridge events for monitoring and coordination
4. **Clean separation of concerns** - Call-engine handles call center logic, session-core handles SIP/media

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. Bridge Management API

Added to SessionCoordinator:
```rust
// Core bridge operations
pub async fn bridge_sessions(&self, session1: &SessionId, session2: &SessionId) -> Result<BridgeId>;
pub async fn destroy_bridge(&self, bridge_id: &BridgeId) -> Result<()>;
pub async fn get_session_bridge(&self, session_id: &SessionId) -> Result<Option<BridgeId>>;
pub async fn remove_session_from_bridge(&self, bridge_id: &BridgeId, session_id: &SessionId) -> Result<()>;
pub async fn list_bridges(&self) -> Vec<BridgeInfo>;

// Advanced operations
pub async fn create_bridge(&self) -> Result<BridgeId>;
pub async fn add_session_to_bridge(&self, bridge_id: &BridgeId, session_id: &SessionId) -> Result<()>;
pub async fn subscribe_to_bridge_events(&self) -> mpsc::UnboundedReceiver<BridgeEvent>;
```

#### 2. Bridge Event System

```rust
pub enum BridgeEvent {
    ParticipantAdded { bridge_id: BridgeId, session_id: SessionId },
    ParticipantRemoved { bridge_id: BridgeId, session_id: SessionId, reason: String },
    BridgeDestroyed { bridge_id: BridgeId },
}
```

#### 3. Session Management Enhancements

- Improved session state tracking
- Better error handling and recovery
- Support for concurrent operations

#### 4. Call-Engine Integration

Call-engine now:
- Uses SessionCoordinator for all session operations
- Leverages bridge management for agent-customer connections
- Monitors bridge events for real-time updates
- No longer depends on transport layers directly

### Migration Guide

For code using the old API expectations:

```rust
// OLD (expected but didn't exist)
use rvoip_session_core::{
    ServerSessionManager, ServerConfig, create_full_server_manager,
    IncomingCallEvent, CallerInfo
};

let server_manager = create_full_server_manager(transaction_manager, config).await?;

// NEW (actual implementation)
use rvoip_session_core::{
    SessionCoordinator, SessionManagerBuilder,
    CallSession, CallHandler, CallDecision
};

let coordinator = SessionManagerBuilder::new()
    .with_sip_port(5060)
    .with_handler(Arc::new(MyCallHandler))
    .build_with_transaction_manager(transaction_manager)
    .await?;
```

### Current Status

✅ **Complete** - Call-engine successfully integrates with session-core:
- All imports resolved
- Bridge management working
- Event system functional
- Tests passing
- Examples updated

### Architecture Benefits

1. **Unified API**: One SessionCoordinator interface serves all use cases
2. **Clean Separation**: Call-engine focuses on call center logic, not SIP details
3. **Flexibility**: Bridge abstraction enables future multi-party support
4. **Monitoring**: Event system provides real-time visibility
5. **Scalability**: Architecture supports clustering and distribution

### Next Steps

The integration is complete. Future enhancements could include:
- Multi-party conference support (extending bridges beyond 2 parties)
- Advanced media operations (recording, transcoding)
- Enhanced monitoring and metrics
- Distributed session management
