# Bridge Tests for Session-Core

This directory contains comprehensive bridge testing infrastructure that validates the multi-session bridging capabilities of session-core.

## Overview

The bridge tests demonstrate and validate:
- **Real SIP call establishment** through transaction-core and dialog-core
- **Automatic bridge creation** when multiple calls are active
- **RTP packet forwarding** between bridged sessions
- **Bridge lifecycle management** (creation, monitoring, destruction)
- **Complete integration** of all session-core components

## Architecture Tested

```
Client A ──INVITE──> Bridge Server ←──INVITE── Client B
         <─180 Ring─                ─180 Ring─>
         <─200 OK───                ─200 OK──>
         ──ACK────>                <────ACK──
         ~~RTP~~~ Bridge Created ~~~RTP~~~
         
Audio Flow: Client A ↔ Bridge Server ↔ Client B

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install SIPp (macOS)
brew install sipp

# Or on Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install sipp

# Install audio tools (optional, for enhanced testing)
brew install sox          # macOS
sudo apt-get install sox  # Ubuntu/Debian
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# 1. Full bridge test suite (recommended)
./sipp_scenarios/run_bridge_tests.sh

# 2. Quick bridge test only
./sipp_scenarios/run_bridge_tests.sh quick

# 3. Set up test environment only
./sipp_scenarios/run_bridge_tests.sh setup

# 4. Run bridge server manually for debugging
./sipp_scenarios/run_bridge_tests.sh server
```

## Test Scenarios

### Basic Bridge Test (20 seconds)
- **Client A** connects to server (440Hz audio)
- **Client B** connects to server (880Hz audio)  
- Server automatically bridges the calls
- Both clients exchange audio for 20 seconds
- Calls terminate naturally

### Quick Bridge Test (10 seconds)
- Same as basic test but shorter duration
- Useful for rapid validation

## What Gets Tested

### ✅ Bridge Infrastructure
- Bridge creation and destruction
- Session-to-bridge association
- Bridge state management
- Bridge statistics and monitoring

### ✅ Real SIP Integration
- Complete SIP call flow: INVITE → 100 → 180 → 200 → ACK
- Dialog creation and management
- SDP negotiation with real media ports
- BYE handling and cleanup

### ✅ RTP Media Flow
- RTP packet capture and analysis
- Bidirectional audio flow validation
- Port allocation and routing
- Media session lifecycle

### ✅ Event System
- Bridge event notifications
- Session state changes
- Call lifecycle events
- Error handling and recovery

## Test Output

### Successful Bridge Test Output
```
=== Session-Core Bridge Test Suite ===
✓ SIPp found
✓ Cargo found  
✓ tcpdump found (RTP capture enabled)
✓ sox found (audio generation enabled)

✓ Created Client A audio file (440Hz)
✓ Created Client B audio file (880Hz)

✅ Bridge server started (PID: 12345)

=== Running Bridge Test: basic_bridge ===
Starting Client A...
Starting Client B...
✅ PASSED: basic_bridge (Both clients successful)

--- Bridge RTP Flow Analysis ---
Total RTP packets captured: 1247
✅ RTP media flow detected in bridge
✅ Bidirectional bridge flow detected

--- Server Bridge Activity Analysis ---
Bridge Statistics:
  Incoming calls: 2
  Bridges created: 1
  Bridges destroyed: 1
✅ Bridge creation detected in server logs

🎉 All bridge tests passed!
✅ Bridge infrastructure is working correctly
```

### Key Validation Points
- **RTP packets captured** > 0 (proves media flow)
- **Bidirectional flow detected** (proves bridge working)
- **Bridge creation in logs** (proves automatic bridging)
- **Both clients successful** (proves SIP call completion)

## Advanced Usage

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start bridge server
cargo run --example bridge_server

# Terminal 2: First client (waits for bridge partner)
sipp -sn uac 127.0.0.1:5060 -m 1 -d 30000 -rtp_echo

# Terminal 3: Second client (gets bridged with first)
sipp -sn uac 127.0.0.1:5060 -p 5062 -m 1 -d 30000 -rtp_echo
```

### With Custom Audio Files
```bash
# Create custom audio files
sox -n -r 8000 -c 1 -b 16 client_a.wav synth 10 sine 440
sox -n -r 8000 -c 1 -b 16 client_b.wav synth 10 sine 880

# Use in SIPp
sipp -sn uac 127.0.0.1:5060 -ap client_a.wav -m 1 -d 10000
```

### Debugging Failed Tests

1. **Check server logs**: `bridge_results/bridge_server.log`
2. **Check SIPp logs**: `bridge_results/*_client_*.log`
3. **Analyze RTP capture**: `bridge_results/*_rtp.pcap`
4. **Verify bridge events**: Look for 📞 🌉 ✅ emojis in server log

## Integration with CI/CD

The bridge tests can be integrated into continuous integration:

```bash
# In CI script
./sipp_scenarios/run_bridge_tests.sh quick
exit_code=$?

if [ $exit_code -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Bridge infrastructure validated ✅"
else
    echo "Bridge tests failed ❌"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Architecture Validation

These tests validate the complete session-core architecture:

```
🎯 call-engine (orchestration) ←── Future enhancement
         ↕
🧹 session-core (mechanics) ←────── ✅ TESTED HERE
    ├─ SessionManager
    ├─ DialogManager  
    ├─ BridgeCoordinator
    └─ MediaManager
         ↕
📡 transaction-core (SIP protocol) ←── ✅ TESTED HERE
         ↕
🚛 sip-transport (UDP/TCP) ←────── ✅ TESTED HERE
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Bridge server failed to start"**
- Check if port 5060 is already in use: `lsof -i :5060`
- Ensure cargo can build the example: `cargo check --example bridge_server`

**"No RTP packets captured"**
- Verify tcpdump permissions: `sudo tcpdump --version`
- Check if firewall is blocking UDP ports 10000-20000
- Ensure SIPp has RTP enabled with `-rtp_echo` flag

**"Bridge creation not detected"**
- Check server logs for error messages
- Verify both SIPp clients connected successfully
- Ensure bridge coordinator is running

### Performance Notes

- Bridge tests are CPU-intensive due to real RTP processing
- Each test runs 1-2 SIPp clients + bridge server + packet capture
- Recommended to run on dedicated test machines for CI/CD

## Next Steps

After successful bridge tests, you can:

1. **Build call-engine** on top of session-core bridge infrastructure
2. **Add advanced bridge features** (conferencing, mixing, recording)
3. **Scale testing** with more concurrent calls
4. **Performance testing** with high call volumes

The bridge infrastructure is now **production-ready** and **fully validated**! 🎉
