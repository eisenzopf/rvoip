# Session Core - TODO List

This document tracks planned improvements and enhancements for the `rvoip-session-core` library.

## 🚨 PHASE 12: ARCHITECTURAL REFACTORING - MOVE BUSINESS LOGIC TO CALL-ENGINE ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

### 🎯 **GOAL: Fix Separation of Concerns Violations**

**Context**: Architectural review identified that **2,400+ lines of business logic** were incorrectly placed in session-core instead of call-engine. This violates separation of concerns and duplicates functionality.

**Root Issue**: Session-core currently contains sophisticated business orchestration that should be call-engine's responsibility.

**Target Outcome**: Session-core provides **low-level session primitives only**, call-engine handles **business logic and service orchestration**.

### 🚨 **MAJOR VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED**

#### **❌ MOVE TO CALL-ENGINE (Business Logic)**
1. **SessionGroupManager** (934 lines) → `call-engine/src/conference/`
   - Conference call management and lifecycle
   - Transfer group coordination and state management  
   - Leader election algorithms and group policies
   - **Violation**: This is call center business logic, not session primitives

2. **SessionPolicyManager** (927 lines) → `call-engine/src/policy/`
   - Resource sharing policies (Exclusive, Priority-based, Load-balanced)
   - Policy enforcement and violation detection  
   - Business rule evaluation and resource allocation decisions
   - **Violation**: This is business policy enforcement, not session coordination

3. **SessionPriorityManager** (722 lines) → `call-engine/src/priority/`
   - QoS level management (Voice, Video, ExpeditedForwarding) 
   - Scheduling policies (FIFO, Priority, WFQ, RoundRobin)
   - Resource allocation with bandwidth/CPU/memory limits
   - **Violation**: This is service-level orchestration, not session management

4. **Complex Event Orchestration** (50% of CrossSessionEventPropagator) → `call-engine/src/orchestrator/`
   - Business event routing and complex propagation rules
   - Service-level event coordination and filtering
   - **Violation**: This is service orchestration, not basic session pub/sub

#### **✅ KEEP IN SESSION-CORE (Low-Level Primitives)**
1. **SessionDependencyTracker** (655 lines) ✓ **APPROPRIATE**
   - Basic parent-child relationship tracking
   - Dependency state management and cycle detection
   - Automatic cleanup on session termination
   - **Correct**: These are low-level session relationship primitives

2. **Basic Event Bus** (50% of CrossSessionEventPropagator) ✓ **APPROPRIATE**  
   - Simple pub/sub between sessions
   - Basic event filtering and session-to-session communication
   - **Correct**: Basic session communication primitives

3. **Basic Session Sequencing** (50% of SessionSequenceCoordinator) ✓ **APPROPRIATE**
   - Simple A-leg/B-leg session linking
   - Basic sequence state tracking
   - **Correct**: Low-level session coordination primitives

- ✅ **FIXED**: Updated `build_sdp_answer()` to accept actual `session_id` parameter
- ✅ **FIXED**: Pass real session ID to `coordinate_session_establishment()` 
- ✅ **FIXED**: Media sessions now properly mapped to actual session IDs
- ✅ **FIXED**: BYE processing now finds and terminates media sessions correctly

**Evidence of Success**:
```
Before Fix: ❌ No media session found for cleanup - may have already been cleaned up or never created
After Fix:  ✅ Found media session for cleanup → 🛑 Media flow terminated successfully
```

- 🔄 **Call Transfer Scenarios** - Dynamic participant management
- 🎯 **Scalable Audio Distribution** - Full-mesh RTP forwarding topology
- 📈 **Enterprise Features** - Foundation for advanced call features

## 🎯 **WHAT'S NEXT - CLEAN ARCHITECTURAL PATH**

### **🔥 CLEAN SEPARATION ACHIEVED:**

Session-core is now properly focused on **mechanics and infrastructure**! The orchestration and policy tasks have been moved to call-engine where they belong.

### **Current Focus: Multi-Session Bridging Mechanics (Phase 7.3)**
**🛠️ Build the infrastructure that call-engine will orchestrate**
- **Session Bridge Infrastructure**: Technical bridging capabilities
- **RTP Forwarding Mechanics**: Low-level packet routing
- **Bridge API for Call-Engine**: Clean interface for orchestration
- **Event System**: Bridge notifications for call-engine consumption

**Why This Is Perfect**: Session-core provides the tools, call-engine makes the decisions!

### **Clean API Design**:
```rust
// call-engine orchestrates using session-core infrastructure:
let bridge_id = session_manager.create_bridge().await?;
session_manager.add_session_to_bridge(bridge_id, session_a_id).await?;
session_manager.add_session_to_bridge(bridge_id, session_b_id).await?;
// RTP flows automatically - call-engine decides policy, session-core handles mechanics
```

### **🎯 NEXT STEPS:**
- **A**: Start building session bridge infrastructure (Phase 7.3.1)
- **B**: Design the session bridge API for call-engine
- **C**: Plan out the complete RTP forwarding mechanics

**Ready to build the bridging infrastructure that call-engine will orchestrate!** 🚀

## 🎯 **SESSION-CORE SCOPE DEFINITION**

**session-core is responsible for**:
- ✅ **Dialog Management**: RFC 3261 dialog lifecycle and state management
- ✅ **Session Coordination**: Bridging SIP signaling with media processing
- ✅ **Media Integration**: Coordinating SDP negotiation and RTP session setup
- ✅ **Audio Processing**: Enhanced audio capabilities and codec negotiation
- ✅ **Session Lifecycle**: Complete call flow coordination (INVITE → established → terminated)
- ✅ **Session Metrics**: Session-level monitoring and performance tracking

**session-core is NOT responsible for**:
- ❌ **Business Logic**: Authentication, registration, call routing policies
- ❌ **User Management**: User databases, location services, presence
- ❌ **Call Features**: Call transfer, forwarding, conferencing (these are call-engine responsibilities)
- ❌ **Administrative Functions**: System management, configuration, monitoring infrastructure
- ❌ **Transport Security**: TLS, authentication challenges (handled by lower layers or call-engine)

This maintains clean separation of concerns with session-core focused on its core responsibility: **session and dialog coordination**.

// Works - SessionManager accepts any DialogManager
let dialog_manager = DialogManager::new(DialogManagerConfig::Client(config)).await?;
SessionManager::new(dialog_manager, config, event_bus).await?; // ✅ Works!
```

### 🚀 **NEXT ACTIONS**

1. **Wait for dialog-core Phase 9** to complete unified DialogManager
2. **Monitor dialog-core progress** for API availability
3. **Start Phase 10.1** as soon as unified DialogManager is available
4. **Test incrementally** to ensure no regressions

**Note**: Most complexity moved to dialog-core where it belongs. Session-core changes are minimal! 🎯
