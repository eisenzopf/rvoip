# Example 9: WebRTC Integration

This example demonstrates how to integrate SIP signaling with WebRTC media, creating a bridge between traditional SIP infrastructure and modern web-based real-time communications.

## What You'll Learn

- How to use SIP signaling for WebRTC sessions
- How to handle WebRTC-specific SDP formats and attributes
- How to process ICE candidates in SIP messages
- How to build a SIP-to-WebRTC gateway
- How to integrate modern web technologies with traditional VoIP systems
- Best practices for cross-platform communication applications

## Running the Example

```bash
# Run the example
cargo run --example 09_webrtc_integration

# Run with debug logs for more details
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --example 09_webrtc_integration
```

## Code Walkthrough

The example is divided into several parts:

1. **WebRTC SDP Handling**
   - Creating WebRTC-compatible SDP offers and answers
   - Handling special WebRTC attributes (ICE, DTLS, etc.)
   - Integrating ICE candidates into SDP
   - Converting between different SDP formats

2. **SIP Signaling for WebRTC**
   - Using SIP INVITE/OK/ACK for WebRTC session establishment
   - Handling SIP INFO messages for trickle ICE
   - Managing media negotiation via SIP signaling
   - Implementing a complete signaling flow

3. **WebRTC Gateway Implementation**
   - Creating a SIP-to-WebRTC bridge
   - Routing calls between different technologies
   - Handling identity and addressing translation
   - Session management across platforms

4. **Modern Communication Application**
   - Implementing a modern communication architecture
   - Designing for cross-platform compatibility
   - Structuring the application for extensibility
   - Best practices for interoperability

## Key Concepts

### WebRTC Session Description

WebRTC uses SDP (Session Description Protocol) with specific extensions:

- **ICE Candidates**: Information for NAT traversal and connectivity
- **DTLS Parameters**: For secure media encryption
- **Media Constraints**: Codecs, bandwidth, and feature requirements
- **Trickle ICE**: Progressive discovery and exchange of connection options

### SIP-WebRTC Integration

There are several approaches to integrating SIP with WebRTC:

1. **SDP Pass-through**: Use SIP to exchange WebRTC-compatible SDP directly
2. **SDP Transformation**: Convert between WebRTC and traditional SDP formats
3. **Trickle ICE via INFO**: Use SIP INFO messages to exchange ICE candidates
4. **Media Gateway**: Terminate WebRTC media and bridge to traditional RTP

### Signaling Flow

A typical WebRTC-over-SIP flow includes:

1. Initial INVITE with WebRTC SDP offer
2. Provisional responses (100, 180)
3. 200 OK with WebRTC SDP answer
4. ACK to establish the session
5. Optional INFO messages for trickle ICE
6. BYE to terminate the session

### Gateway Architecture

A SIP-WebRTC gateway typically includes:

- **SIP Stack**: For traditional VoIP signaling
- **WebRTC Stack**: For modern web-based media
- **Signaling Translator**: Converts between signaling protocols
- **Media Bridge**: Handles media format conversion if needed
- **Identity System**: Maps between SIP URIs and web identities

## Real-World Applications

This integration pattern enables several modern communication scenarios:

1. **Web-based SIP Clients**: Allow users to make/receive calls directly in browsers
2. **SIP Access to WebRTC Services**: Bridge traditional phones to WebRTC platforms
3. **Unified Communications**: Create seamless experience across different devices
4. **Contact Centers**: Build web-based contact centers with SIP PSTN access
5. **Enterprise Communications**: Integrate modern web tools with existing PBX systems
