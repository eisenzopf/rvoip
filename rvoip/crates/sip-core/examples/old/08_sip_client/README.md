# Example 8: Complete SIP Client

This example demonstrates how to build a complete SIP client application using the rvoip-sip-core library. It implements a functional User Agent that can register with a SIP server, make outgoing calls, and receive incoming calls.

## What You'll Learn

- How to build a complete SIP client application
- How to implement SIP registration with a server
- How to make and receive SIP calls
- How to manage SIP dialogs and call state
- How to work with asynchronous SIP processing using Tokio
- How to properly handle retransmissions and timeouts
- How to structure a complete SIP application

## Running the Example

```bash
# Run the example
cargo run --example 08_sip_client

# Run with debug logs to see detailed SIP messages
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --example 08_sip_client
```

## Code Walkthrough

The example implements a complete SIP client with the following components:

1. **SIP Client Core**
   - Manages the overall state of the SIP client
   - Handles registration with a SIP server
   - Maintains active calls and dialogs
   - Provides an API for making and receiving calls

2. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Uses a message-passing approach with Tokio channels
   - Handles SIP events asynchronously
   - Maintains clean separation between the client API and SIP processing

3. **SIP Message Creation**
   - Creates properly formatted SIP requests for registration and calls
   - Sets appropriate header values, tags, and branch parameters
   - Handles Content-Type and SDP bodies for media negotiation

4. **Call Management**
   - Tracks call state through the entire lifecycle
   - Handles multiple simultaneous calls
   - Manages dialog state for in-dialog requests and responses

5. **Simulation of Network**
   - For demonstration purposes, simulates network communication
   - Shows expected behavior and message flow

## Application Structure

The example is structured around several key components:

### SipClient

The main client class that provides the public API and coordinates SIP activities:
- Registration management
- Call control
- Event handling

### SipEvent

An enum representing different events in the SIP system:
- `Register`: Register with a SIP server
- `Unregister`: Unregister from the server
- `MakeCall`: Make an outgoing call
- `EndCall`: Terminate an active call
- `IncomingCall`: Handle a new incoming call

### Call

A struct representing an active call:
- Call identifiers (Call-ID, tags)
- Call state tracking
- From/To information
- Timestamps

### Event Loop

The core processing loop that:
- Receives SIP events
- Creates appropriate SIP messages
- Handles retransmissions and timeouts
- Updates call state

## Key Concepts

### SIP Registration

The client demonstrates the complete registration process:
1. Creating a REGISTER request
2. Setting appropriate Contact and Expires headers
3. Handling authentication challenges (simulation)
4. Processing registration responses
5. Maintaining registration with periodic refreshes

### Call Flow

The example shows a complete call flow:
1. Creating an INVITE request with SDP offer
2. Processing provisional responses (180 Ringing)
3. Handling 200 OK with SDP answer
4. Sending ACK to establish the dialog
5. Call termination with BYE

### Dialog Management

The client properly manages SIP dialogs:
1. Tracking dialog identifiers (Call-ID, From tag, To tag)
2. Maintaining dialog state
3. Using correct CSeq values for in-dialog requests
4. Setting Route headers for in-dialog routing

### Asynchronous Processing

The example demonstrates proper asynchronous SIP processing:
1. Non-blocking I/O with Tokio
2. Event-driven architecture with channels
3. Proper handling of concurrent operations
4. Clean separation of concerns

## Real-World Considerations

In a production SIP client, you would also need to consider:

1. **Transport Layer Integration**
   - UDP/TCP/TLS socket handling
   - NAT traversal techniques
   - Connection management

2. **Media Handling**
   - RTP/RTCP implementation
   - Audio/video codec negotiation
   - Media path establishment

3. **Advanced Security**
   - TLS for signaling security
   - SRTP for media encryption
   - Certificate validation

4. **Reliability Features**
   - RFC 3261 transaction layer
   - Proper retransmission handling
   - Failover support

5. **User Interface**
   - Call notifications
   - Audio/video rendering
   - User controls

## Next Steps

After mastering this example, you can proceed to Example 9 which demonstrates WebRTC integration with SIP signaling.
