## Layer Responsibility Clarification

The `rtp-core` crate is responsible for all packet-level operations in the media transport layer:

1. **RTP/RTCP Packet Processing**
   - Parsing and serialization of RTP/RTCP packets
   - Packet header manipulation
   - Sequence number and timestamp handling
   - SSRC/CSRC management
   - Extension handling

2. **Network Transport**
   - Socket management for RTP/RTCP
   - Packet transmission and reception
   - Network address handling
   - ICE integration and candidate management
   - Connection management

3. **Security**
   - DTLS handshake and key exchange
   - SRTP/SRTCP encryption and decryption
   - Authentication and replay protection
   - Key management and rotation

4. **Buffer Management**
   - Packet-level jitter buffer
   - Memory optimization and pooling
   - Transmit queue management
   - Packet prioritization

5. **Statistics and Monitoring**
   - Jitter calculation
   - Packet loss tracking
   - Round-trip time measurement
   - RTCP report generation
   - Network quality metrics

## New: Developer API for Media-Core Integration

The current API exposes too many implementation details, making it hard for `media-core` to properly integrate. We'll create a new simplified API layer specifically designed for `media-core` integration.

### API Design Principles
- Hide implementation details while providing required functionality
- Use high-level abstractions for common operations
- Provide event-based notification for asynchronous operations
- Create builder patterns for complex configurations
- Use strongly typed interfaces to prevent misuse

### API Client/Server Separation

The current API intermingles client and server responsibilities, causing confusion and complexity. We'll separate these concerns into dedicated client and server modules, similar to the successful approach used in transaction-core.

#### DTLS-SRTP Handshake Improvements

The current implementation has significant challenges with DTLS-SRTP handshakes due to intermingled client/server logic:

- Currently: Single `SecureMediaContext` tries to handle both client and server roles, leading to complex conditional logic and timing issues.

- Improved approach:
  - `ClientSecurityContext` will focus solely on initiating handshakes, sending ClientHello, and handling client-specific verification.
  - `ServerSecurityContext` will focus on listening for ClientHello messages, responding appropriately, and managing server-side security.
  - Clear separation of handshake state machines without branching logic.
  - Specific timeouts and retry mechanisms tailored to each role.
  - Simpler notification mechanisms for handshake completion.
  - Dedicated packet handling optimized for each role's requirements.

This separation will resolve the current DTLS handshake issues by eliminating role confusion and allowing each implementation to focus on its specific responsibilities in the security negotiation process.
