# RTP Demo Summary

## What We Achieved âœ…

### 1. Complete SIP Signaling
- âœ… INVITE with SDP offer
- âœ… 200 OK with SDP answer  
- âœ… ACK acknowledgment
- âœ… BYE termination
- âœ… Multiple concurrent calls

### 2. SDP Negotiation
- âœ… Codec negotiation (PCMU/PCMA)
- âœ… Dynamic RTP port allocation
- âœ… Proper SDP formatting
- âœ… Media capabilities exchange

### 3. Media Session Creation
- âœ… RTP sessions created on both UAC and UAS
- âœ… Local RTP ports bound successfully
- âœ… UDP sockets ready for media
- âœ… Unique SSRC generation for each session

### 4. Audio Generation
- âœ… 440Hz test tone generator active
- âœ… RTP packets generated with proper:
  - Sequence numbers
  - Timestamps  
  - SSRC values
  - Payload formatting

## Current Limitation ðŸš§

### Missing Remote Endpoint Configuration

The RTP packets are being generated but dropped with "No destination address for RTP packet" because:

1. **The Real Issue**: The `MediaInfo` structure in `session-core` DOES have `remote_sdp` and `remote_rtp_port` fields, but they're not being populated because:
   - The SDP from the 200 OK response needs to be processed via `update_remote_sdp()`
   - This is not automatically done during SIP response handling
   - The client needs to explicitly call `process_sdp_answer()` after receiving 200 OK

2. **The Solution**: After receiving 200 OK with SDP:
   ```rust
   // Process the SDP answer to store remote endpoint info
   client.process_sdp_answer(&call_id, sdp_from_200_ok).await?;
   
   // Now MediaInfo will have remote_sdp populated
   let media_info = client.get_call_media_info(&call_id).await?;
   // media_info.remote_sdp will be Some(sdp)
   
   // Extract and establish media flow
   let remote_addr = extract_rtp_address_from_sdp(&media_info.remote_sdp.unwrap());
   client.establish_media(&call_id, &remote_addr).await?;
   ```

## Demo Workaround

For testing purposes, you can enable hardcoded RTP endpoint:

```bash
DEMO_RTP_HARDCODE=1 ./run_test.sh
```

This will use a hardcoded address (127.0.0.1:30000) to demonstrate RTP flow.

## What Would Work With Proper Integration

The proper fix requires:
1. SIP layer to notify when 200 OK with SDP is received
2. Call `process_sdp_answer()` to store the remote SDP
3. Then `establish_media()` with the extracted remote endpoint

## Code Architecture

The demo shows proper separation of concerns:
- **UAC/UAS**: High-level call control using `ClientManager`
- **Media**: Handled by `media-core` with `AudioTransmitter`
- **RTP**: Managed by `rtp-core` with proper packet formatting
- **SDP**: Negotiated by `session-core` with proper storage

The session-core layer properly stores SDP in `sdp_storage` and includes it in `MediaInfo` when requested, but the client needs to populate it by processing SDP responses.

## Running the Demo

```bash
cd rvoip/crates/client-core/examples/client-server
./run_test.sh

# Or with hardcoded RTP endpoint for testing:
DEMO_RTP_HARDCODE=1 ./run_test.sh
```

This will:
1. Start a UAS server on port 5070
2. Launch a UAC client making 2 calls
3. Show complete SIP signaling
4. Demonstrate RTP packet generation
5. Highlight the missing remote endpoint configuration (or work with hardcoded endpoint)
