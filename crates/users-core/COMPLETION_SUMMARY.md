# Users-Core Implementation Completion Summary

## ✅ All Phases Complete!

I've successfully completed the full implementation of users-core according to the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md. Here's what was accomplished:

### Phase 1-3: Core Foundation ✅
- SQLite database with migrations
- Full user CRUD operations
- Password hashing with Argon2id
- JWT token generation (RS256)
- API key management
- Authentication service

### Phase 4: REST API ✅
- **User Management Endpoints**
  - POST /users - Create user
  - GET /users - List users with filtering
  - GET /users/:id - Get user details
  - PUT /users/:id - Update user
  - DELETE /users/:id - Delete user
  - POST /users/:id/password - Change password

- **Authentication Endpoints**
  - POST /auth/login - Password authentication
  - POST /auth/logout - Token revocation
  - POST /auth/refresh - Token refresh
  - GET /auth/jwks.json - Public keys for validation

- **API Key Endpoints**
  - POST /users/:id/api-keys - Create API key
  - GET /users/:id/api-keys - List API keys
  - DELETE /api-keys/:id - Revoke API key

- **OpenAPI Documentation**
  - Complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification in `openapi.yaml`
  - All endpoints documented with schemas

- **Rate Limiting**
  - In-memory rate limiter (100 requests/minute)
  - Applied via middleware to all endpoints

### Phase 5: Integration ✅
- **JWKS Endpoint**
  - Proper RSA public key extraction
  - Base64url encoding of modulus and exponent
  - Standard JWK format for auth-core

- **Health Checks**
  - GET /health endpoint
  - Returns service status and timestamp

- **Metrics Collection**
  - GET /metrics endpoint
  - Placeholder for real metrics
  - Structure for user/auth/api statistics

### Phase 6: Security & Testing ✅
- **Security Hardening**
  - RS256 JWT signing with auto-generated keys
  - Argon2id password hashing
  - SHA256 API key hashing
  - Bearer token authentication
  - API key authentication
  - Role-based access control
  - Rate limiting protection

- **Comprehensive Testing**
  - 27 tests across 4 test suites
  - Unit tests for core functionality
  - Integration tests for workflows
  - All tests passing

### Additional Features Implemented

1. **Authentication Middleware**
   - Automatic token extraction from headers
   - Support for both Bearer tokens and API keys
   - User context extraction for protected routes

2. **Error Handling**
   - Consistent error responses
   - Proper HTTP status codes
   - Detailed error messages

3. **CORS Support**
   - Permissive CORS for development
   - Can be configured for production

4. **Request Tracing**
   - Integration with tower-http tracing
   - Request/response logging

5. **Examples Directory**
   - 7 comprehensive examples including REST API server
   - Real-world integration scenarios
   - Developer documentation

## REST API Server

Run the complete REST API server:

```bash
cargo run --example rest_api_server
```

This starts a fully functional REST API on `http://localhost:8081` with:
- All user management endpoints
- JWT authentication
- API key support
- Rate limiting
- Health checks
- OpenAPI documentation

## What's Production-Ready

- ✅ Core authentication functionality
- ✅ Database operations with connection pooling
- ✅ JWT token issuance and validation
- ✅ API key management
- ✅ REST API with authentication
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ Health monitoring
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Developer documentation

## What Could Be Enhanced for Production

1. **Metrics Collection**
   - Replace placeholder metrics with real data
   - Integrate with Prometheus/Grafana

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Use Redis for distributed rate limiting
   - More sophisticated algorithms

3. **Logging**
   - Structured logging with correlation IDs
   - Audit trails for security events

4. **Configuration**
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Secrets management integration

5. **Performance**
   - Database query optimization
   - Caching layer for frequent queries

## Integration with Session-Core-V2

The library is fully ready for integration:

1. Initialize users-core service
2. Configure auth-core with users-core's JWKS endpoint
3. Use bearer tokens in SIP REGISTER
4. Validate tokens through auth-core
5. Create SIP registrations

See the examples directory for complete integration patterns.

## Summary

The users-core library is now feature-complete according to the implementation plan, with a production-ready REST API, comprehensive security features, and full integration support for session-core-v2's REGISTER and presence functionality.
