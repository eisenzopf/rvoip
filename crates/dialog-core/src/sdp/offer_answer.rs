//! SDP Offer/Answer Model Implementation
//!
//! This module implements the SDP offer/answer model as defined in RFC 3264
//! for use within SIP dialogs. It handles the negotiation process between
//! endpoints to establish media sessions.
//!
//! ## Offer/Answer Flow
//!
//! ```text
//! Offerer                    Answerer
//!    |-- Offer (SDP) -------->|
//!    |<-- Answer (SDP) -------|
//!    |                        |
//! ```
//!
//! ## Key Functions
//!
//! - **Offer Processing**: Parse and validate incoming SDP offers
//! - **Answer Generation**: Create compatible SDP answers based on capabilities
//! - **Media Negotiation**: Match codecs and media parameters
//! - **Session Updates**: Handle offer/answer in re-INVITE scenarios
//!
//! ## Implementation Status
//!
//! Currently SDP processing is handled at the session layer.
//! This module will contain dialog-specific SDP operations when implemented.
