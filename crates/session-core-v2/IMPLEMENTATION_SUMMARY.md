# Session-Core-V2 Implementation Summary

## Completed Refactoring

### Overview
We successfully implemented the simplified architecture plan for `session-core-v2` by removing redundant management layers and centralizing control in the state machine.

### Key Changes Implemented

#### 1. **Removed Redundant Layers**
- ✅ Deleted `SessionManager` 
- ✅ Deleted `CallController`
- ✅ Deleted `ConferenceManager`

These components were duplicating functionality that should be handled by the state machine and state table.

#### 2. **Enhanced State Table**
- ✅ Created comprehensive `enhanced_state_table.yaml` with:
  - Conference support
  - Advanced call control (hold/resume, transfers)
  - DTMF handling
  - Media events
  - Error recovery flows

#### 3. **State Machine Helpers**
- ✅ Created `state_machine/helpers.rs` for operations requiring direct state access:
  - Session creation/management
  - Call control operations
  - Conference management
  - Event subscriptions
  - State queries

#### 4. **Simplified APIs**
- ✅ Replaced `unified.rs` with thin wrapper using state machine helpers
- ✅ Replaced `simple.rs` with simplified peer API
- ✅ Both APIs now directly leverage the state machine

#### 5. **Audio Frame Support**
- ✅ Fixed AudioFrameSubscriber integration with media-core
- ✅ Implemented proper audio frame subscription through MediaAdapter
- ✅ Connected to media-core's relay controller

### Architecture Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: The state table now defines all call flows
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Removed 3 layers of abstraction
3. **Better Maintainability**: Logic centralized in state machine
4. **Clear Separation**: 
   - Adapters: Message passing to external crates
   - Helpers: Internal coordination and state queries
   - State Machine: Pure event-driven logic

### Remaining TODOs

Some methods in the adapters need implementation:
- `restore_direct_media()` in MediaAdapter
- `restore_media_flow()` in MediaAdapter  
- `attempt_recovery()` in MediaAdapter
- Conference-related actions in state machine

### Usage Example

```rust
// Simple API
let peer = SimplePeer::new("Alice").await?;
let call = peer.call("sip:bob@example.com").await?;

// Get audio channels
let audio_subscriber = peer.subscribe_audio(&call.id()).await?;

// Unified API
let config = Config::default();
let coordinator = UnifiedCoordinator::new(config).await?;
let session = coordinator.make_call("sip:alice@example.com", "sip:bob@example.com").await?;
```

## Conclusion

The refactoring successfully achieved the goal of simplifying `session-core-v2` by:
- Removing unnecessary abstraction layers
- Centralizing control in the state machine
- Making the APIs simple wrappers
- Improving maintainability and traceability

The library now follows a clean event-driven architecture where the state table is the single source of truth for all call flows.
