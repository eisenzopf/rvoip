## Summary of Changes

### Features Gained in V2
1. **Event History Tracking**: Comprehensive history with ring buffer, timing, and export

3. **Declarative State Machine**: YAML-based state table for easier maintenance
4. **Better Resource Management**: Improved cleanup with configurable policies
5. **Transition Analysis**: Detailed recording of guards, actions, and timing

### Features Lost/Not Yet Implemented in V2
1. **Conference Support**: No conference coordination
2. **Presence/Subscription**: No presence management
3. **B2BUA Mode**: No back-to-back user agent support
4. **Advanced Media**: Limited DTMF, recording, playback
5. **Protocol Extensions**: No SRTP, ICE, STUN/TURN
6. **Session Groups**: No group management
7. **Priority Management**: No call priority handling
8. **Client/Server Architecture**: No separate client/server modes
9. **Advanced Transfer Features**: Limited transfer capabilities
10. **Message/Publish/Subscribe**: No SIP MESSAGE, PUBLISH, NOTIFY support

### Features Delegated to Other Components
1. **Dialog Management**: Delegated to dialog-core
2. **Media Handling**: Delegated to media-core
3. **RTP Processing**: Delegated to rtp-core
4. **Registration**: Handled by dialog-core

### Architectural Improvements in V2
1. **Code Reduction**: 76% less code while maintaining core functionality
2. **Cleaner Separation**: Clear boundaries between session coordination and protocol handling
3. **Better Testability**: Declarative state table is easier to test and verify
4. **Runtime Configuration**: All features configurable at runtime (not compile-time)
5. **Improved Debugging**: Built-in history and inspection capabilities

## Recommendations

### High Priority Features to Add
1. **DTMF Support**: Enhance DTMF handling for IVR systems
2. **Conference Support**: Add basic conference coordination
3. **B2BUA Mode**: Implement for PBX-like functionality
4. **Enhanced Media Control**: Better recording/playback support

### Medium Priority Features
1. **Presence/Subscription**: For presence-aware applications
2. **Session Groups**: For managing related sessions
3. **Priority Management**: For emergency call handling
4. **SRTP Support**: For secure media

### Low Priority Features
1. **ICE/STUN/TURN**: For NAT traversal (if needed)
2. **Advanced Transfer**: Attended transfer improvements
3. **MESSAGE Support**: For SIP instant messaging
4. **Client/Server Mode**: If deployment model requires it

## Conclusion

The new session-core-v2 successfully reduces complexity by 76% while maintaining core call functionality. It gains powerful debugging and analysis features but loses some advanced features that may need to be re-implemented based on actual usage requirements. The modular architecture with delegation to specialized cores (dialog-core, media-core) provides better separation of concerns and maintainability.
