# Blind Transfer - Complete Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

Phase 1 (Quick Fix) is **COMPLETE**. The transferor (Bob) can now successfully send REFER messages to the transfer recipient (Alice). However, Alice cannot process the REFER and complete the transfer to Charlie.

**Root Cause:** dialog-core receives REFER messages but does NOT publish `TransferRequested` events to session-core.

This document provides a comprehensive Phase 2 implementation plan to complete blind transfer functionality.

---

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ What Works (Phase 1 Complete)

1. **Event Name Alignment**: `InitiateTransfer` ‚Üí `BlindTransfer` everywhere
2. **Transfer Initiation**: Bob can trigger transfer from `Answering` or `Active` states
3. **REFER Message Sending**: `SendREFER` action sends REFER to Alice
4. **REFER Message Reception**: Alice's dialog-core receives REFER (creates ServerNonInviteTransaction)
5. **Transfer Target Capture**: `BlindTransfer` event captures target URI
6. **Event Handler Exists**: session-core has `handle_transfer_requested()` method

### ‚ùå What's Missing (Phase 2 Required)

1. **dialog-core Event Publishing**: When REFER is received, dialog-core does NOT publish `TransferRequested` event
2. **State Table Transitions**: No transitions defined for handling `TransferRequested` event
3. **Transfer Recipient Actions**: No actions to:
   - Accept REFER (send 202 Accepted)
   - Terminate current call (send BYE to Bob)
   - Initiate new call (send INVITE to Charlie)
   - Send NOTIFY to transferor with transfer status

### üìä Test Results

From `/tmp/blind_transfer_test2.log`:

```
‚úÖ Bob: Executes BlindTransfer (Answering ‚Üí Transferring)
‚úÖ Bob: Sends REFER to Alice with target "sip:charlie@127.0.0.1:5062"
‚úÖ Alice: Receives REFER (ServerNonInviteTransaction created)
‚ùå Bob: Receives "481 Call/Transaction Does Not Exist" (Alice didn't respond properly)
‚ùå Alice: Never processes TransferRequested event
‚ùå Alice: Never calls Charlie
‚ùå Charlie: Never receives any call
```

## SIP Blind Transfer Protocol Flow

### RFC 3515 Specification

A complete blind transfer involves these SIP messages:

```
Alice (Transferee)          Bob (Transferor)          Charlie (Transfer Target)
      |                           |                           |
      |<-------- REFER ------------|  (1) Bob sends REFER to Alice
      |                           |      Refer-To: sip:charlie@...
      |                           |
      |--------- 202 Accepted --->|  (2) Alice accepts the REFER
      |                           |
      |--------- NOTIFY --------->|  (3) Alice notifies: "trying"
      |<-------- 200 OK ----------|      (transfer in progress)
      |                           |
      |--------- BYE ------------>|  (4) Alice hangs up with Bob
      |<-------- 200 OK ----------|
      |                           |
      |----------- INVITE ----------------------->|  (5) Alice calls Charlie
      |<---------- 180 Ringing -------------------|
      |<---------- 200 OK ------------------------|
      |----------- ACK -------------------------->|
      |                           |
      |--------- NOTIFY --------->|  (6) Alice notifies: "success"
      |<-------- 200 OK ----------|      (transfer complete)
      |                           |
      |<========== RTP ==========================>|  (7) Alice talks to Charlie
```

### Current vs Required Behavior

| Step | SIP Message | Current State | Required Action |
|------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 | REFER | ‚úÖ Sent by Bob | ‚úÖ Working |
| 2 | 202 Accepted | ‚ùå Not sent | ‚ö†Ô∏è Need Action: AcceptREFER |
| 3 | NOTIFY (trying) | ‚ùå Not sent | ‚ö†Ô∏è Need Action: SendNOTIFY |
| 4 | BYE | ‚ùå Not sent | ‚ö†Ô∏è Need Action: TerminateCurrentCall |
| 5 | INVITE | ‚ùå Not sent | ‚ö†Ô∏è Need Action: InitiateTransferCall |
| 6 | NOTIFY (success) | ‚ùå Not sent | ‚ö†Ô∏è Need Action: SendNOTIFY |
| 7 | RTP | ‚ùå Not established | ‚úÖ Should work once call is made |

## Phase 2: Implementation Plan

### Overview

Phase 2 has **4 major components**:

1. **dialog-core Changes**: Publish `TransferRequested` events when REFER is received
2. **State Table Changes**: Add transitions to handle transfer recipient flow
3. **Action Implementation**: Implement actions for REFER acceptance and call switching
4. **Testing**: Update blind_transfer example to verify end-to-end flow

---

## Component 1: dialog-core Event Publishing

### File: `crates/dialog-core/src/manager/transaction_integration.rs`

**Goal:** When REFER is received, publish `TransferRequested` event to session-core

**Location:** Find where incoming REFER transactions are processed

**Implementation:**

```rust
// In transaction_integration.rs, around the transaction event handling

// When ServerNonInviteTransaction is created for REFER method
if method == Method::REFER {
    // Extract Refer-To header
    let refer_to = request.headers()
        .get("Refer-To")
        .and_then(|h| h.to_str().ok())
        .unwrap_or("unknown");

    // Extract Replaces header if present (attended transfer)
    let replaces = request.headers()
        .get("Replaces")
        .and_then(|h| h.to_str().ok());

    let transfer_type = if replaces.is_some() { "attended" } else { "blind" };

    // Send 202 Accepted response
    self.send_response(&transaction_key, 202, "Accepted").await?;

    // Publish TransferRequested event
    if let Some(coordinator) = &self.event_coordinator {
        let event = DialogToSessionEvent::TransferRequested {
            dialog_id: dialog_id.clone(),
            session_id: session_id.clone(),
            refer_to: refer_to.to_string(),
            transfer_type: transfer_type.to_string(),
        };
        coordinator.publish("dialog_to_session", Arc::new(event)).await?;
    }
}
```

**Files to Modify:**

1. `crates/dialog-core/src/manager/transaction_integration.rs` - Add REFER handling
2. `crates/dialog-core/src/events/dialog_to_session.rs` - Ensure `TransferRequested` variant exists

---

## Component 2: State Table Transitions

### File: `crates/session-core-v2/state_tables/default.yaml`

**Goal:** Define state machine transitions for transfer recipient (Alice)

**Transitions to Add:**

```yaml
# =============================================================================
# BLIND TRANSFER RECIPIENT HANDLING
# =============================================================================

# Transfer recipient receives REFER while in Active call
- role: "UAC"
  state: "Active"
  event:
    type: "TransferRequested"
  next_state: "TransferringCall"
  actions:
    - type: "AcceptREFER"              # Send 202 Accepted
    - type: "SendNOTIFY"               # Send NOTIFY SIP/2.0 100 Trying
    - type: "StoreTransferTarget"      # Store refer_to URI for later
  publish:
    - "TransferReceived"
  description: "UAC receives REFER for blind transfer"

# Also handle if we're still in Initiating state (call not fully active yet)
- role: "UAC"
  state: "Initiating"
  event:
    type: "TransferRequested"
  next_state: "TransferringCall"
  actions:
    - type: "AcceptREFER"
    - type: "SendNOTIFY"
    - type: "StoreTransferTarget"
  publish:
    - "TransferReceived"
  description: "UAC receives REFER during call setup"

# Internal event: After accepting REFER, terminate current call
- role: "UAC"
  state: "TransferringCall"
  event:
    type: "InternalProceedWithTransfer"
  next_state: "Idle"
  actions:
    - type: "TerminateCurrentCall"     # Send BYE to Bob
    - type: "CleanupDialog"
    - type: "CleanupMedia"
  publish:
    - "ReadyForTransferCall"
  description: "Terminate current call to proceed with transfer"

# After cleanup, make new call to transfer target
- role: "UAC"
  state: "Idle"
  event:
    type: "InternalMakeTransferCall"
  next_state: "Initiating"
  actions:
    - type: "CreateDialog"
    - type: "InitiateMedia"
    - type: "SendINVITE"
  publish:
    - "TransferCallInitiated"
  description: "Initiate call to transfer target"

# When transfer call is established, send success NOTIFY
- role: "UAC"
  state: "Active"
  event:
    type: "InternalTransferCallEstablished"
  next_state: "Active"
  actions:
    - type: "SendNOTIFYSuccess"        # NOTIFY SIP/2.0 200 OK
  publish:
    - "TransferCompleted"
  description: "Transfer call established successfully"
```

**State Added:**
- `TransferringCall`: Intermediate state while processing transfer

**Events Added:**
- `InternalProceedWithTransfer`: Trigger to start transfer process
- `InternalMakeTransferCall`: Trigger to call transfer target
- `InternalTransferCallEstablished`: Trigger when transfer succeeds

---

## Component 3: Action Implementation

### File: `crates/session-core-v2/src/state_machine/actions.rs`

**New Actions Required:**

#### 3.1 AcceptREFER

```rust
Action::AcceptREFER => {
    debug!("Accepting REFER request");
    // dialog-core should already send 202 Accepted automatically
    // This action is a placeholder for future enhancements
    info!("REFER accepted for session {}", session.session_id);
}
```

#### 3.2 SendNOTIFY

```rust
Action::SendNOTIFY => {
    debug!("Sending NOTIFY for transfer progress");
    // Send NOTIFY with sipfrag body: "SIP/2.0 100 Trying"
    if let Some(notify_to_dialog) = &session.transfer_notify_dialog {
        dialog_adapter.send_notify(
            notify_to_dialog,
            "refer".to_string(),
            Some("SIP/2.0 100 Trying".to_string())
        ).await?;
        info!("Sent NOTIFY (trying) for transfer");
    }
}
```

#### 3.3 SendNOTIFYSuccess

```rust
Action::SendNOTIFYSuccess => {
    debug!("Sending NOTIFY for transfer success");
    // Send NOTIFY with sipfrag body: "SIP/2.0 200 OK"
    if let Some(notify_to_dialog) = &session.transfer_notify_dialog {
        dialog_adapter.send_notify(
            notify_to_dialog,
            "refer".to_string(),
            Some("SIP/2.0 200 OK".to_string())
        ).await?;
        info!("Sent NOTIFY (success) for transfer");
    }
}
```

#### 3.4 StoreTransferTarget

```rust
Action::StoreTransferTarget => {
    debug!("Storing transfer target from REFER");
    // Transfer target is already captured from TransferRequested event
    // This action ensures it's persisted in session state
    if let Some(target) = &session.transfer_target {
        info!("Stored transfer target: {}", target);
    }
}
```

#### 3.5 TerminateCurrentCall

```rust
Action::TerminateCurrentCall => {
    debug!("Terminating current call for transfer");
    // Send BYE to current dialog
    dialog_adapter.send_bye(&session.session_id).await?;

    // Wait briefly for BYE to complete
    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;

    info!("Terminated current call for session {}", session.session_id);

    // Trigger next step: make transfer call
    self.process_event(
        &session.session_id,
        EventType::InternalMakeTransferCall
    ).await?;
}
```

**Note:** `TerminateCurrentCall` is different from `SendBYE` - it includes cleanup and triggers the next phase.

### File: `crates/session-core-v2/src/session_store/state.rs`

**Add field to SessionState:**

```rust
pub struct SessionState {
    // ... existing fields ...

    /// Dialog to send NOTIFY messages to (for transfer progress)
    pub transfer_notify_dialog: Option<DialogId>,
}
```

### File: `crates/session-core-v2/src/state_machine/executor.rs`

**Capture transfer info from TransferRequested event:**

```rust
// In process_event(), before state table lookup:

EventType::TransferRequested { refer_to, transfer_type } => {
    session.transfer_target = Some(refer_to.clone());
    session.transfer_notify_dialog = session.dialog_id.clone(); // Send NOTIFY back to Bob
    debug!("Captured transfer request: target={}, type={}", refer_to, transfer_type);
}
```

### File: `crates/session-core-v2/src/state_table/yaml_loader.rs`

**Add new action types to parser:**

```rust
"AcceptREFER" => Ok(Action::AcceptREFER),
"SendNOTIFY" => Ok(Action::SendNOTIFY),
"SendNOTIFYSuccess" => Ok(Action::SendNOTIFYSuccess),
"StoreTransferTarget" => Ok(Action::StoreTransferTarget),
"TerminateCurrentCall" => Ok(Action::TerminateCurrentCall),
```

### File: `crates/session-core-v2/src/state_table/types.rs`

**Add new action variants:**

```rust
pub enum Action {
    // ... existing actions ...

    // Transfer recipient actions
    AcceptREFER,
    SendNOTIFY,
    SendNOTIFYSuccess,
    StoreTransferTarget,
    TerminateCurrentCall,
}
```

**Add new event types:**

```rust
pub enum EventType {
    // ... existing events ...

    // Transfer coordination events
    InternalProceedWithTransfer,
    InternalMakeTransferCall,
    InternalTransferCallEstablished,
}
```

### File: `crates/session-core-v2/src/state_table/types.rs`

**Add new state:**

```rust
pub enum CallState {
    // ... existing states ...
    TransferringCall,  // Intermediate state during transfer processing
}
```

---

## Component 4: Orchestration & Timing

### Challenge: Asynchronous State Transitions

The transfer flow requires **multiple asynchronous steps**:

1. Accept REFER ‚Üí Send NOTIFY ‚Üí Terminate call ‚Üí Make new call ‚Üí Send NOTIFY

**Problem:** Actions execute synchronously within a single state transition.

**Solution:** Use internal events to chain transitions:

```
TransferRequested ‚Üí [AcceptREFER, SendNOTIFY, StoreTarget] ‚Üí TransferringCall
                 ‚Üì (emit InternalProceedWithTransfer)
TransferringCall ‚Üí [TerminateCurrentCall, Cleanup] ‚Üí Idle
                 ‚Üì (emit InternalMakeTransferCall from TerminateCurrentCall action)
Idle ‚Üí [CreateDialog, InitiateMedia, SendINVITE] ‚Üí Initiating
     ‚Üì (normal call flow)
Active ‚Üí [SendNOTIFYSuccess] ‚Üí Active
```

### Implementation in `actions.rs`:

```rust
Action::TerminateCurrentCall => {
    debug!("Terminating current call for transfer");
    dialog_adapter.send_bye(&session.session_id).await?;
    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;

    // After BYE, trigger transition to Idle and then make transfer call
    // This is done by emitting internal events

    // Store the transfer target before state changes
    let transfer_target = session.transfer_target.clone()
        .ok_or_else(|| SessionError::InternalError("No transfer target".to_string()))?;

    // The state machine will transition to Idle automatically
    // We need to schedule the next call after this action completes

    // Use a helper to schedule the call after cleanup
    let session_id = session.session_id.clone();
    let state_machine = self.state_machine.clone();

    tokio::spawn(async move {
        // Wait for cleanup to complete
        tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(200)).await;

        // Make the transfer call
        if let Err(e) = state_machine.process_event(
            &session_id,
            EventType::MakeCall { target: transfer_target }
        ).await {
            error!("Failed to make transfer call: {}", e);
        }
    });
}
```

**Better Approach:** Use `publish` events to trigger next transition:

In `default.yaml`:
```yaml
- role: "UAC"
  state: "TransferringCall"
  event:
    type: "DialogBYE"  # Wait for BYE confirmation
  next_state: "Idle"
  actions:
    - type: "CleanupDialog"
    - type: "CleanupMedia"
  publish:
    - "TransferCallTerminated"
  description: "Current call terminated, ready for transfer"

# Then have a listener trigger MakeCall when cleanup is done
```

---

## Component 5: Testing Updates

### File: `crates/session-core-v2/examples/blind_transfer/peer1_caller.rs`

**Update Alice to handle transfer:**

```rust
// After call is established
println!("[ALICE] üí¨ Talking to Bob...");
sleep(Duration::from_secs(5)).await;

println!("[ALICE] ‚è≥ Waiting for Bob to transfer me to Charlie...");
sleep(Duration::from_secs(8)).await;

// After transfer, Alice should be talking to Charlie
println!("[ALICE] üí¨ Now talking to Charlie (post-transfer)...");
sleep(Duration::from_secs(3)).await;

println!("[ALICE] üì¥ Hanging up with Charlie...");
// Hangup will now terminate the call with Charlie, not Bob
alice.hangup(&incoming.id).await?;
```

### Expected Log Output

After implementation, we should see:

```
[BOB] Executing transition: Answering + BlindTransfer ‚Üí Transferring
[BOB] REFER sent to Alice
[ALICE] Received TransferRequested: refer_to=sip:charlie@127.0.0.1:5062
[ALICE] Executing transition: Active + TransferRequested ‚Üí TransferringCall
[ALICE] 202 Accepted sent to Bob
[ALICE] NOTIFY (trying) sent to Bob
[ALICE] Executing transition: TransferringCall + InternalProceedWithTransfer ‚Üí Idle
[ALICE] BYE sent to Bob
[BOB] Received 202 Accepted (transfer accepted)
[BOB] Received NOTIFY (trying)
[BOB] Received BYE from Alice
[BOB] Dialog terminated
[ALICE] Executing transition: Idle + MakeCall ‚Üí Initiating
[ALICE] INVITE sent to Charlie
[CHARLIE] Received incoming call from Alice
[CHARLIE] 200 OK sent to Alice
[ALICE] Received 200 OK from Charlie
[ALICE] Executing transition: Initiating + Dialog200OK ‚Üí Active
[ALICE] NOTIFY (success) sent to Bob
[BOB] Received NOTIFY (success) - transfer complete
```

---

## Implementation Phases

- Verify TransferRequested event is published when REFER is received

### Phase 2B: Actions (Estimated: 3-4 hours)

**Files:**
1. `session-core-v2/src/state_machine/actions.rs` - Implement all 5 new actions
2. `session-core-v2/src/state_machine/executor.rs` - Capture transfer info from event

**Testing:**
- Unit tests for each action
- Verify NOTIFY messages are sent
- Verify BYE is sent to terminate current call

### Phase 2C: State Table (Estimated: 1-2 hours)

**Files:**
1. `session-core-v2/state_tables/default.yaml` - Add all transfer recipient transitions

**Testing:**
- Load state table and verify transitions are parsed
- Run blind_transfer example and check state transitions in logs

### Phase 2D: Integration & Testing (Estimated: 2-3 hours)

**Files:**
1. `examples/blind_transfer/peer1_caller.rs` - Update timing and expectations
2. `examples/blind_transfer/run_blind_transfer.sh` - Increase timeout if needed

**Testing:**
- Run full blind_transfer example
- Verify Charlie receives the transferred call
- Verify Bob receives NOTIFY messages
- Check for any race conditions or timing issues

**Total Estimated Time: 8-12 hours**

## Success Criteria

A successful implementation will produce this test output:

```
‚úÖ Bob initiates blind transfer
‚úÖ Alice receives REFER
‚úÖ Alice sends 202 Accepted to Bob
‚úÖ Alice sends NOTIFY (trying) to Bob
‚úÖ Alice sends BYE to Bob
‚úÖ Bob receives all responses
‚úÖ Alice makes new call to Charlie
‚úÖ Charlie receives incoming call from Alice
‚úÖ Charlie answers call
‚úÖ Alice and Charlie establish media
‚úÖ Alice sends NOTIFY (success) to Bob
‚úÖ Bob receives transfer success notification
‚úÖ Test completes without errors or timeouts
```

---

## Alternative Approach: Simplified Flow

If the full RFC 3515 flow is too complex, we can implement a **simplified blind transfer** without NOTIFY messages:

### Simplified Flow

```
1. Bob sends REFER to Alice
2. Alice sends 202 Accepted
3. Alice sends BYE to Bob
4. Alice makes new call to Charlie
5. Done (no NOTIFY messages)
```

This removes the NOTIFY actions and simplifies testing, but is **not RFC compliant**.

**Recommendation:** Implement full flow for production readiness.

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Adding new event types ‚úÖ
- Adding new state ‚úÖ
- Implementing AcceptREFER, StoreTransferTarget ‚úÖ

### Medium Risk
- Coordinating asynchronous state transitions ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Timing issues between BYE and new INVITE ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Session ID management during transfer ‚ö†Ô∏è

### High Risk
- dialog-core changes (could affect other features) üî¥
- Race conditions in state machine ‚ö†Ô∏è
- NOTIFY message sequencing ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **For dialog-core changes:** Make changes minimal and focused only on REFER handling
2. **For timing issues:** Add internal delays and use event-driven transitions
3. **For race conditions:** Use proper locking and state validation
4. **For testing:** Add extensive logging and run multiple iterations

---

## Future Enhancements (Post Phase 2)

1. **Attended Transfer Support:** Use REFER with Replaces header
2. **Transfer Status Subscription:** Bob subscribes to Alice's transfer events
3. **Transfer Failure Handling:** Handle cases where transfer call fails
4. **Multiple Transfer Types:** Support consultative and supervised transfers
5. **Transfer to Conference:** Allow transferring to multi-party conference

---

## Conclusion

Phase 2 requires changes across multiple layers:
- **dialog-core:** Publish TransferRequested events
- **session-core state table:** Add transfer recipient transitions
- **session-core actions:** Implement 5 new actions
- **session state:** Add transfer tracking fields

The most complex part is **coordinating asynchronous state transitions** to ensure the call to Charlie happens after the call to Bob is properly terminated.

Estimated total implementation time: **8-12 hours** for a complete, tested solution.
