# SRTP Implementation

This document summarizes the SRTP (Secure RTP) implementation added to the rvoip-rtp-core library.

## Implementation Overview

The SRTP implementation follows RFC 3711 and provides:

1. **Encryption Algorithms**:
   - AES-CM (Counter Mode) encryption
   - NULL encryption (for authentication-only mode)

2. **Authentication Algorithms**:
   - HMAC-SHA1 authentication with 80-bit output
   - HMAC-SHA1 authentication with 32-bit output
   - NULL authentication (for encryption-only mode)

3. **Key Management**:
   - Session key derivation from master keys
   - IV generation for encryption
   - SRTP context management

4. **Tamper Detection**:
   - Authentication tag verification
   - Replay protection

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

- `srtp/mod.rs`: Main SRTP module with constants and cipher suite definitions
- `srtp/crypto.rs`: Implementation of encryption and authentication operations
- `srtp/auth.rs`: Authentication tag calculation and verification
- `srtp/key_derivation.rs`: Key derivation functions and IV generation
- `srtp/protected.rs`: Protected RTP/RTCP packet handling

### Security Improvements

The implementation includes key security features:

1. **Authentication Tag Handling**: Fixed a critical issue where authentication tags were being discarded, compromising security. Added a `ProtectedRtpPacket` struct to properly handle authentication tags.

2. **Tamper Detection**: Added proper verification of authentication tags to detect modified packets. Test cases verify that tampering with the payload or authentication tag is detected.

3. **Cipher Support**: Implemented all standard SRTP cipher suites, including AES-CM and HMAC-SHA1 variants.

4. **Key Derivation**: Implemented standard key derivation functions following RFC 3711 Section 4.3.

### API Changes

The following API changes were made to improve security:

1. `encrypt_rtp` now returns a tuple of `(RtpPacket, Option<Vec<u8>>)`, where the second element is the authentication tag.

2. Added the `ProtectedRtpPacket` struct to encapsulate an encrypted packet and its authentication tag.

3. `decrypt_rtp` now handles authentication tag verification properly, rejecting packets that fail verification.

## Testing

The implementation has been thoroughly tested with:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - `test_complete_srtp_process`: Verifies full encryption/decryption cycle
   - `test_tamper_detection`: Verifies detection of tampered packets
   - `test_aes_cm_encryption`: Tests AES-CM encryption specifically
   - `test_hmac_sha1`: Tests HMAC-SHA1 authentication

2. **Examples**:
   - `srtp_crypto.rs`: Tests all cipher combinations
   - `srtp_protected.rs`: Demonstrates authentication handling and tamper resistance

## Issues Fixed

During implementation, the following issues were identified and fixed:

1. Authentication tag handling was incorrectly implemented (tags were discarded)
2. Key derivation wasn't properly following RFC 3711
3. AES-CM encryption was using an incorrect IV format
4. The IV generation did not account for the required SSRC and index fields

## Remaining Work

All core SRTP functionality is now working correctly. There are some unrelated test failures in other parts of the library that don't affect SRTP functionality:

1. Buffer/jitter tests: Some timing and sequence number issues
2. Payload format tests for VP8/VP9: Byte size calculation discrepancies
3. RTCP XR tests: Structure size mismatches
