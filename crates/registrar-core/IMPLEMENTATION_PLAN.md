### üéØ Next Priority Tasks
1. **Complete SimplePeer Integration** - Wire up register() and unregister() methods to use RegistrarService
2. **Background Tasks** - Implement expiry cleanup for registrations and subscriptions
3. **Integration Tests** - Full end-to-end testing of registration and presence flows
4. **Performance Testing** - Verify 10,000+ user capacity claims

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional Requirements**
   - [x] User registration with multiple contacts
   - [x] Presence state management
   - [x] Subscription handling
   - [x] Automatic buddy lists (B2BUA mode)
   - [x] Event-driven updates

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - [ ] Handle 10,000+ registered users (not tested)
   - [x] Sub-millisecond lookups (DashMap provides this)
   - [x] Concurrent access support

3. **Integration Requirements**
   - [x] Clean API for session-core
   - [x] Event bus integration
   - [x] P2P and B2BUA modes

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **PIDF XML Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with basic PIDF, enhance later
   
2. **Event Bus Performance**
   - Mitigation: Implement batching early

3. **Memory Usage**
   - Mitigation: Implement expiry from the start

### Integration Risks
1. **Session-core coupling**
   - Mitigation: Clear interface boundaries
   
2. **Event ordering**
   - Mitigation: Event sequence numbers

## Dependencies

- `infra-common`: Event bus system
- `sip-core`: SIP types and parsing
- `quick-xml`: PIDF XML handling
- `dashmap`: Concurrent hashmaps
- `tokio`: Async runtime

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test each module in isolation
- Mock dependencies
- Property-based testing for concurrent ops

### Integration Tests
- Full user journey tests
- Multi-user interaction tests
- Event flow verification

### Performance Tests
- Concurrent registration benchmark
- Presence update throughput
- Memory usage under load

## Delivery Milestones

1. **Week 1**: Core functionality (Phases 1-3)
   - Basic registration
   - Simple presence
   - Event publishing

2. **Week 2**: Full features (Phases 4-6)
   - Complete API
   - Automatic buddy lists
   - Full test coverage

## Open Questions

1. Should we support persistent storage in v1?
2. How many devices per user should we support?
3. Should presence policies be in v1 or v2?
4. Do we need presence aggregation for multiple devices?

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this plan
2. Set up the crate structure
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Daily progress updates
