## Audit Commands

```bash
# Run audit for specific annex
./scripts/audit_g729.sh [annex_name]

# Example usage:
./scripts/audit_g729.sh base
./scripts/audit_g729.sh annex_a
./scripts/audit_g729.sh annex_b

# Run all test vectors for an annex
./scripts/test_vectors.sh [annex_name]

# Generate audit report
./scripts/generate_audit_report.sh
```

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Base G.729 implementation** (Phase 1.1-1.9 from implementation plan)
2. **Set up CI/CD pipeline** for automated test vector validation
3. **Implement G.729A** (most commonly used variant)
4. **Add Annex B** (essential for VoIP applications)
5. **Continue with other annexes** based on priority

## Notes

- Update this document after completing each major milestone
- All test vector files are available in `tests/test_data/`
- Maintain audit trail for compliance validation
- Each annex must pass ALL criteria before being marked complete
