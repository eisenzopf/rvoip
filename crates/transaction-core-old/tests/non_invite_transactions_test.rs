/// Non-INVITE Transaction Tests for SIP according to RFC 3261
///
/// This test suite verifies the behavior of non-INVITE transactions in the rVOIP transaction-core
/// library according to RFC 3261 Sections 17.1.2 (Non-INVITE Client Transaction) and 17.2.2 
/// (Non-INVITE Server Transaction).
///
/// RFC 3261 Compliance Verification:
///
/// 1. Non-INVITE Client Transaction (Section 17.1.2):
///    - Initial state should be "Trying" 
///    - After receiving a provisional response (1xx), should transition to "Proceeding"
///    - After receiving a final response (2xx-6xx), should transition to "Completed"
///    - After Timer K expires in Completed state, should transition to "Terminated"
///
/// 2. Non-INVITE Server Transaction (Section 17.2.2):
///    - Initial state should be "Trying"
///    - After sending a provisional response, should transition to "Proceeding"
///    - After sending a final response, should transition to "Completed"
///    - After Timer J expires in Completed state, should transition to "Terminated"
///
/// 3. Response Categories (Section 21):
///    - 1xx responses are provisional/informational
///    - 2xx responses indicate success
///    - 3xx responses are redirects but handled as failures by the transaction layer
///    - 4xx-6xx are various error responses
///
/// Notes about implementation:
/// - Some implementations may optimize by transitioning directly from Trying/Proceeding
///   to Terminated after a final response, which is acceptable as an optimization
/// - Timer durations are shortened in the test environment to speed up tests
///
/// Test Coverage:
/// 1. test_non_invite_direct_flow: Tests a complete non-INVITE transaction flow including:
///    - Client transaction creation and request sending
///    - Server transaction creation and handling
///    - Provisional response handling (100 Trying)
///    - Final response handling (200 OK)
///    - State transitions
///    - Transaction termination
///
/// 2. test_verify_no_redirect_response: Verifies that 3xx redirect responses
///    are properly handled as FailureResponse events by the transaction layer,
///    not as a separate RedirectResponse category.
