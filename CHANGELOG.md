## 0.3.4 — 2026-07-29

This coordinated 44-crate patch release adds exact inbound-admission terminal
notification, completes RFC 6026 INVITE Accepted lifecycles, and introduces a
bounded RFC 3261 transaction-stateful proxy profile updated by RFC 4320 and
RFC 6026.

### Added

- Exact-generation inbound admission termination notification for cancelled,
  remotely ended, and failed source legs without polling.
- Compact, sharded Timer M/L retention driven by the existing manager-owned
  deadline queues rather than per-transaction runners and sleeper tasks.
- Matched/unmatched proxy CANCEL handling, fork response contexts, multiple
  and late 2xx forwarding, ACK ownership, Timer C, response aggregation, and
  strict/loose routing coverage within the documented bounded profile.
- Fail-closed Kamailio/OpenSIPS interoperability and four-peer beta-report
  attestation tooling for future strict full-beta runs.
- `rvoip-release-carry-forward-attestation-v1` release verification.

### Fixed

- Atomic, generation-protected transaction timer firing removes a saturated
  command-channel race that could strand expired transactions.
- Accepted transactions shed active runners, transports, command queues, and
  active-only locks while preserving RFC retention and exact cleanup.
- INVITE retransmission, late response, Via/route, RFC 3263 failover, and
  stateful-proxy response behavior have focused regression coverage.

### Qualification

The owner approved `0.3.4` with a transparent carry-forward disposition. The
full `0.3.4` beta, four-peer interoperability matrix, and long soaks were not
rerun. Current evidence is the complete workspace release verification and one
clean revision-bound canonical 2,000-CPS/65,000-call real-media PASS. The
immutable `0.3.2` owner-approved exception remains historical background with
strict status `NON-RC` and is not relabeled as a current beta PASS.

## 0.3.3 — 2026-07-29

This unified patch release corrects the vCon wire model, Session-finalization
path, signatures, content hashes, stores, and documentation against
`draft-ietf-vcon-vcon-core` commit
`2342aba64bdb71d9e80ab6e274a3921e2b1c769e`.

### Fixed

- End-of-Session emission now converts snapshots into the canonical
  `rvoip-vcon` model, validates them, serializes with serde, and suppresses
  persistence/`VconReady` on conversion, validation, or serialization failure.
  Inline dialog, analysis, and attachment bodies are preserved as Base64Url.
- The container now uses vCon `0.4.0`, durations in seconds, required analysis
  vendor/encoding data, attachment placement and purpose fields, URL/hash
  dependencies, complete dialog/party fields, and mutually exclusive
  redacted/amended lineage.
- vCon signatures now use JWS General JSON Serialization with appendable
  signatures and certificate references. Compact JWT serialization is no
  longer emitted as a signed vCon.
- New store handles use the specified
  `sha512-<unpadded-base64url-digest>` content hash in memory and PostgreSQL.
  The typed `VconStore` contract exposes the stored content hash, and identical
  canonical documents hash identically across memory and PostgreSQL. Existing
  persisted legacy hashes are not rewritten.
- Federation documentation no longer assigns semantics to reserved core
  `group`; sibling-vCon grouping is deferred to a future named extension
  declared in `extensions[]`.
- Documentation now states the shipped security boundary: core emission is
  unsigned, JWS signing is explicit, JWE is absent, and lineage types do not
  perform redaction.

### Added

- Canonical draft example/schema conformance coverage and a dedicated vCon CI
  job, including live PostgreSQL store tests and affected integration
  boundaries.
- Hash- and commit-bound `--targeted-delta-attestation` release verification.
  It retains unified manifest, workspace compile, and package checks while
  honestly recording that broad beta/workspace test/doc suites were not
  rerun. The approved targeted matrix is rerun and live PostgreSQL evidence is
  machine-verified.

### Breaking vCon changes

- `sign_jws` now accepts a certificate reference and returns `SignedVcon`;
  `append_signature` adds another signer, and verification accepts the General
  JSON form. HMAC algorithms are rejected for this certificate-bound API.
- Dialog `duration_ms` becomes `duration` in seconds. The model adds the
  standard party, dialog, analysis, attachment, extension, and critical
  fields. The undeclared Party `role` field is removed; the core `type` field
  classifies parties (for example, `person`, `bot`, or `organization`), while
  role semantics require a declared extension.
- `redacted: Vec<RedactionRecord>` becomes one optional `Redacted` object and
  gains the mutually exclusive optional `Amended` object.
- Core vCon analysis vendors and attachment placement become required;
  attachment `note` becomes `purpose`; party `did_or_stir` splits into `did`
  and `stir`; and snapshot encoding is fallible. The core byte-store `put`
  contract now also receives `ConversationId` and exposes
  `list_for_conversation` so sibling vCons are linked in index metadata rather
  than through the reserved `group` parameter.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-07-29

This unified release advances the reusable Bridgefu 1.0 foundation across all
44 publishable workspace crates.

### Added

- Hash-bound release-exception reporting for the owner-approved 0.3.2
  candidate, with the strict 106/108 gate result and NON-RC qualification
  preserved rather than rewritten.
- Complete authenticated-principal propagation and ownership checks across
  SIP, WebRTC, UCTP, routes, and operational events.
- Transport-neutral `DataMessage`, arbitrary WebRTC DataChannels, SIP MESSAGE,
  typed initial SIP headers, DTMF, and correlated transfer outcomes.
- Single-consumer `MediaGraph` with directional routes, codec-group
  transcoding, bounded fanout, snapshots, drops/evictions, and metrics.
- Dormant prepare/bind/activate lifecycles for SIP, WebRTC, and Amazon Connect,
  including owned cancellation, terminal events, and bounded drain.
- SIP outbound activation receipts now linearize after the exact session is
  active. Established teardown waits for the peer's successful final BYE
  response while still reclaiming local state on timeout or rejection.
- UCTP 0.2 complete-RTP routing, authenticated raw QUIC/WebTransport sessions,
  virtual publishers, direct-listener limits, and exact cleanup.
- `rvoip-moq` draft-19/MSF-01/LOC-03 publisher, subscriber, origin, relay,
  authorization, compatibility, reconnect, health, and drain abstractions.
- Configurable symmetric RTP, advertised SIP/RTP addresses, RFC 3581 `rport`,
  WebRTC ICE server/NAT policy, and per-exchange WHIP/WHEP versus WS gathering.
- Developer-preview `rvoip-vapi` bidirectional WebSocket agent adapter, exposed
  by the facade's opt-in `vapi` feature and included in `full`.
- High-level `rvoip::app` voice-only admission for SIP or WebRTC customers,
  including transport-neutral accepted-call events, startup-safe event
  retention, explicit SIP/RTP advertisement, and example 14's shared Vapi
  agent server.

### Fixed

- SCIM provisioning now generates policy-safe bootstrap passwords without
  random failures from repeated/sequential characters or username overlap.

### Breaking protocol changes

- UCTP media datagrams now carry a complete RTP packet after the UCTP header.
- Wire-incompatible MOQT draft changes are semver-breaking at the
  `rvoip-moq` compatibility boundary.
- `rvoip_core_traits::connection::Transport` adds the `Vapi` variant; downstream
  exhaustive matches over this public enum must add a corresponding arm.
- `rvoip::app::AppEvent` adds the `InboundCallAccepted` variant; downstream
  exhaustive matches over this public enum must add a corresponding arm.

The private WebRTC/RTC TURN candidate and the dynamic moq-rs publisher-lease
candidate remain outside the consumed dependency graph until project-owner
review. No upstream submission is authorized by this changelog.
